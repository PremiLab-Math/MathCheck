It is given that CB = 4.0 cm, DB = 7.0 cm, and D is the midpoint of AC.\n\nStep 2: Notice that D is the midpoint of AC, so AD equals DC.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the length of DC by subtracting the length of CB from DB to get DC. We do this because CB and DC are part of the whole segment DB.

    "image": "images/17.jpg",
    "solution": "Step 1: Note that triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at C, so we can apply Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of sides AC and BC.\nStep 2: Since D is the midpoint of AB, AD = DB = AB/2 = 10/2 = 5.\nStep 3: Apply Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABC: AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2. Given AB = 10, we have AC^2 + BC^2 = 100.\nStep 4: We are given that CE = 3. Since E is on AC, we can say AC = AE + CE. But we don't have the length of AE yet.\nStep 5: To find CD, we will use the fact that triangle ADC is similar to triangle ABC (they are both right triangles and share the angle at A).\nStep 6: The similarity gives us the proportion AC/AB = AD/AC, which means that AC^2 = AD * AB. Plugging in the known values gives AC^2 = 5 * 10 = 50.\nStep 7: Knowing AC^2 helps us find BC by substituting back into the Pythagorean theorem in step 3: 50 + BC^2 = 100, which simplifies to BC^2 = 50.\nStep 8: Therefore, BC = sqrt(50). Since we need to find CD, we recognize that CD = BC because D is the midpoint of AB.\nStep 9: BC = CD = sqrt(50). Simplifying that gives BC = CD = 5 * sqrt(2).\nStep 10: Now we have the length of CD in its simplest radical form.\n\nThe answer is 5 * sqrt(2).",

In parallelogram ABCD, AB = AC, which means triangle ABC is isosceles, and ∠CAB = 40°.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Thus, ∠CAB = ∠ADC, so ∠ADC = 40°.\n\nStep 3: Understand that ∠ABC in triangle ABC is the vertex angle of the isosceles triangle, so it is equal to ∠ACB.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the remaining angles in triangle ABC. The sum of angles in any triangle is 180°. We have one angle which is 40°. Therefore, the sum of the other two angles (which are equal) is 180° - 40° = 140°.\n\nStep 5: Since angles ∠ABC and ∠ACB are equal, each is half of 140°. Therefore, ∠ABC = ∠ACB = 140° / 2 = 70°.\n\nStep 6: Return to parallelogram ABCD. Since opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal, ∠ABC = ∠DCB, so ∠DCB = 70°.\n\nStep 7: Find ∠D by adding angles ∠ADC and ∠DCB within triangle DBC. ∠D = ∠ADC + ∠DCB = 40° + 70°.\n\nStep 8: Calculate the sum to find the measure of ∠D. ∠D = 40° + 70° = 110°.\n\nThe answer is 110°.",

The formula is \\( AD^2 = AC^2 + CD^2 \\).\nStep 5: Substitute AC with 8 cm (half the original length of the rubber band AB), and CD with 6 cm (the distance the midpoint C is pulled up to D).\nStep 6: Calculate \\( AD^2 = 8^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 \\).\nStep 7: Find the value of \\( AD^2 \\) which equals 100.\nStep 8: Take the square root of \\( AD^2 \\) to find AD. \\( AD = \\sqrt{100} = 10 \\) cm.\nStep 9: Calculate the new length of each half of the rubber band which is now 10 cm instead of the original 8 cm.\nStep 10: Multiply this length by 2 to get the new total length of the rubber band since we have two sides, AD and BD: \\( 10 \\times 2 = 18 \\) cm.\nStep 11: Subtract the original length of the rubber band (16 cm) from the new total length (18 cm) to find the increase in length.\nStep 12: Perform the subtraction \\( 18 - 16 \\).\n\nThe answer is 2 cm.",

    "solution": "Step 1: Recognize that when the midpoint C of an elastic band AB is pulled up to point D, creating two right-angled triangles, namely ACD and BCD.\n\nStep 2: Note that in each right triangle, AD (and similarly BD) is the hypotenuse, and the original length of the half band, which is AC (or BC), plus half of the stretched length, is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\nStep 3: Set up the equation for the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem. According to the given information, the half of the rubber band AB is pulled 6 cm up to create a right-angled triangle, and the hypotenuse (the length of the half of the stretched rubber band, which is AD) becomes half of the original length of the band plus half of the 4 cm increase in length.\n\nStep 4: Let the original length of the rubber band be x cm, so each half of the band before stretching is x/2 cm. After the band is stretched, half of the length increase (which is 4 cm / 2 = 2 cm) is added to each half, making the length of each half of the rubber band AD or BD = x/2 + 2 cm.\n\nStep 5: Use the Pythagorean theorem in one of the right-angled triangles, let's say triangle ACD, where AC is x/2, CD is 6 cm (the height the band is pulled), and AD is x/2 + 2 cm (the new length of half the band when stretched).\n\nStep 6: The Pythagorean theorem states that AD^2 = AC^2 + CD^2. Plug the values into the equation: (x/2 + 2)^2 = (x/2)^2 + 6^2.\n\nStep 7: Expand the equation: (x/2 + 2)(x/2 + 2) = (x/2)(x/2) + 36.\n\nStep 8: Simplify the equation: x^2/4 + 4x/2 + 4 = x^2/4 + 36.\n\nStep 9: Subtract x^2/4 from both sides to get: 4x/2 + 4 = 36.\n\nStep 10: Simplify further to get: 2x + 4 = 36.\n\nStep 11: Subtract 4 from both sides to get: 2x = 32.\n\nStep 12: Divide both sides by 2 to solve for x: x = 32 / 2.\n\nStep 13: Calculate to find the value of x: x = 16.\n\nThe answer is: x = 16 cm.",

    "solution": "Step 1: Note that ∠AOE is bisected by OD, creating two angles of 50 degrees each.\nStep 2: Since OD bisects ∠AOE, ∠AOD = ∠DOE = 50 degrees.\nStep 3: Remember that ∠BOC is given as 50 degrees.\nStep 4: Know that ∠AOC is 80 degrees more than ∠BOC, so ∠AOC = ∠BOC + 80 degrees = 50 degrees + 80 degrees.\nStep 5: Calculate ∠AOC, which is 50 + 80 = 130 degrees.\nStep 6: ∠AOC and ∠BOC form a straight line, meaning together they sum up to 180 degrees because they are supplementary angles.\nStep 7: Based on the fact that ∠AOC and ∠BOC are supplementary, subtract the sum of ∠AOC (130 degrees) and ∠BOC (50 degrees) from 180 degrees to find ∠COE.\nStep 8: Calculate ∠COE as 180 degrees - (130 degrees + 50 degrees) = 0 degrees, which is not correct; we actually need to subtract only ∠AOC from 180 degrees because it represents the entire angle from AO to CO.\nStep 9: Recalculate ∠COE correctly as 180 degrees - 130 degrees = 50 degrees.\nStep 10: Now, we know ∠AOB = 180 degrees (it's a straight line), hence subtract ∠AOD (50 degrees) from ∠AOB (180 degrees) to get ∠DOB.\nStep 11: Calculate ∠DOB as 180 degrees - 50 degrees = 110 degrees.\nStep 12: Since we know ∠COE, and OD is a straight line, then ∠DOE is equal to ∠COE, which is 50 degrees.\nStep 13: Finally, since ∠EOB is part of the larger angle, ∠DOB, subtract ∠DOE from ∠DOB to get ∠EOB.\nStep 14: Calculate ∠EOB as ∠DOB - ∠DOE = 110 degrees - 50 degrees.\nStep 15: Complete the calculation, ∠EOB = 60 degrees.\n\nThe answer is 60 degrees.",

    "solution": "Step 1: Identify that ABCD is a parallelogram, which means opposite sides are equal (AB = CD and AD = BC).\n\nStep 2: Recognize that CE bisects ∠BCD, so ∠BCE ≅ ∠ECD.\n\nStep 3: Since CE is an angle bisector in a parallelogram, triangles BCE and ECD are congruent by Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) congruence. This means BC = CD (from the parallelogram property) and BE = ED (from the congruent triangles).\n\nStep 4: Since DE = x, it follows that BE = x by the congruence of triangles BCE and ECD.\n\nStep 5: Because AB = CD as ABCD is a parallelogram, and AB is given as 3, it follows that CD = 3.\n\nStep 6: Since CD = BE + ED and CD = 3, we substitute BE and ED with x (from step 4), so 3 = x + x.\n\nStep 7: Simplify the equation to find the value of x: 3 = 2x.\n\nStep 8: Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x: x = 3/2.\n\nThe answer is x = 3/2.",

Therefore, ∠ABC is equal to ∠D, which is given as 55.0°.\n\nStep 2: Understand that in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180°. Since ∠ABC is 55.0°, ∠ABE (which is supplementary to ∠ABC) must be 180° - 55.0° = 125.0°.\n\nStep 3: Observe that triangle ABE is a right triangle because CE is perpendicular to AB.

    "question": "In the triangle ABC shown in the diagram, the line AD bisects angle BAC and intersects side BC at point D. A perpendicular line from D to AB is drawn, creating a perpendicular segment DE with a foot at point E. If the length of DE is 3 units and the length of AC is 4 units, find the area of triangle ADC.",

    "solution": "Step 1: Identify the known elements in the triangle ABC. We know DE is 3 units and AC is 4 units.\nStep 2: Recognize that DE is perpendicular to AB, which means DE is the height (h) of triangle ADB from base AB.\nStep 3: Realize that since AD bisects angle BAC, triangles ADE and CDE are similar because they share the angle at D and have right angles at E.\nStep 4: Because the triangles ADE and CDE are similar, the ratio of their sides is equal. Therefore, the ratio of DE to AE (in triangle ADE) is equal to the ratio of DE to EC (in triangle CDE).\nStep 5: Note that AC (the length of side AC) is the sum of AE and EC.\nStep 6: Express AE as AC - EC, knowing that AE + EC = AC.\nStep 7: Set up the proportion DE/AE = DE/EC and substitute AE with AC - EC to find the relationship between AE and EC.\nStep 8: Solve the proportion for AE or EC to find the length of each segment.\nStep 9: Once AE and EC are known, calculate the area of triangle ADC using the formula Area = 1/2 * base * height.\nStep 10: Use AC as the base and DE as the height to calculate the area because DE is perpendicular to AB and thus perpendicular to the extension of AC, which makes it the height of triangle ADC from base AC.\nStep 11: Plug in the known values into the area formula. Since AC = 4 units and DE = 3 units, Area = 1/2 * 4 * 3.\n\nThe answer is 6 square units.",

    "solution": "Step 1: Recognize that the shortest distance from a point to a line (in this case, from point O to chord AB) is the perpendicular distance.\n\nStep 2: Realize that when you draw the perpendicular from O to AB, it will bisect AB because in a circle, a perpendicular from the centre to a chord bisects the chord.\n\nStep 3: Since AB is bisected, each half will measure 4.0 (because AB is 8.0 in total length).\n\nStep 4: Now we can form a right-angled triangle with the radius as the hypotenuse (length 5.0), half of the chord AB as one leg (length 4.0), and the other leg as the line from O to a point halfway along AB—which we are trying to find.\n\nStep 5: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the perpendicular line from O to AB (which we'll call X). The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (radius) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nStep 6: So, the equation is \\( radius^2 = X^2 + (AB/2)^2 \\).\n\nStep 7: Plug the known values into the equation: \\( 5.0^2 = X^2 + 3.0^2 \\).\n\nStep 8: Calculate the values: \\( 25 = X^2 + 9 \\).\n\nStep 9: Simplify the equation to find X: \\( X^2 = 25 - 9 \\).\n\nStep 10: Perform the subtraction: \\( X^2 = 16 \\).\n\nStep 11: Take the square root of both sides to solve for X: \\( X = 4 \\).\n\nThe answer is 4.0.",

    "solution": "Step 1: Recognize that AD is the median of triangle ABC, which means point D is the midpoint of BC.\nStep 2: Since E is the midpoint of AD, we then know that AE = ED.\nStep 3: Observe that triangle ABE and triangle ADE share the same height from A and have equal bases AE and ED.\nStep 4: Consequently, the areas of triangles ABE and ADE are equal. Let the area of triangle ABE be x; thus, the area of triangle ADE is also x.\nStep 5: Because D is the midpoint of BC, triangle ADB has the same base length as triangle ADC, and they share the same height from A.\nStep 6: Thus, the area of triangle ADB is equal to the area of triangle ADC.\nStep 7: The area of triangle ABE is ½ the area of triangle ADB (since E is the midpoint of AD). If the area of triangle ABE is x, the area of triangle ADB is 2x.\nStep 8: Similarly, the area of triangle ADC is also 2x.\nStep 9: The total area of triangle ABC is the sum of the areas of triangles ADB and ADC, which is 2x + 2x.\nStep 10: Add the areas for the whole triangle: 2x + 2x = 4x.\nStep 11: Now, we know that the area of triangle ABC is given to be 8 times the area of triangle ABE, which is 8x.\nStep 12: Equate the two expressions for the area of triangle ABC: 4x = 8x.\n\nMissing some steps to solve the problem. Let's continue:\nStep 13: Since the total area of triangle ABC is made up of the areas of triangles ADE, ADB, and ADC (with ADE already established as x and ADB + ADC together known to be equal to 4x), we need to establish the ratio of the areas correctly.\nStep 14: Note that triangle ABE constitutes one part of the four equal parts into which triangle ABC is divided by segments AD and BE.\nStep 15: That means the area of triangle ABE is 1/4 of the total area of triangle ABC.\nStep 16: If the area of triangle ABE is x, then the total area of triangle ABC is 4 * x, or 4x.\nStep 17: The given total area is 8 times the area of triangle ABE, hence the total area of triangle ABC is also 8x.\nStep 18: Setting the two expressions for the total area of triangle ABC to be equal, we have 4x = 8x.\nStep 19: This is a contradiction because it would require x to be 0 for equality to hold, which doesn't make sense in the context of the area of a triangle.\nStep 20: Realize the mistake in step 18. Since we established that the area of triangle ABE is x and it's 1/4 of the total area of triangle ABC, we should multiply x by 4 to find the total area.\nStep 21: So, the correct total area of triangle ABC is 4 * x = 4x, which we are told is equal to 8 times the area of triangle ABE.\nStep 22: Therefore, 4x should be set equal to 8x, where x represents the area of triangle ABE.\nStep 23: Upon reevaluating, it's clear that there has been a misunderstanding in the initial steps. The area of triangle ABC is actually made up of two areas of 4x each (from triangle ADB and triangle ADC), not two of 2x each. Let's correct this.\nStep 24: Hence, we should summarize that triangle ABC is divided equally into four triangles of equal area by its medians: ABE, ADE, BDC, and ADC.\nStep 25: Each of these four triangles has an area of x, as established for triangle ABE.\nStep 26: To find the area of triangle ABC, we multiply the area of one of the smaller triangles (x) by 4, since there are four of them.\nStep 27: Therefore, the correct relationship is 4x = the area of triangle ABC.\nStep 28: We are given that the area of triangle ABC is 8 times the area of triangle ABE, so we substitute in the value of 8x for the area of triangle ABC.\nStep 29: Aligning the two expressions, we now have 4x = 8x for the total area of triangle ABC, which must be a mistake.\nStep 30: Correcting the error, we should compare the number of triangle ABE areas in triangle ABC to what is given. There are four such areas in triangle ABC as each of the four triangles within ABC is equal in area to ABE.\nStep 31: Therefore, the correct expression would be 4 * the area of ABE = the total area of triangle ABC.\nStep 32: The given information states that the total area of triangle ABC is 8 times the area of ABE, hence 8 * the area of ABE = the total area of triangle ABC.\nStep 33: Putting it all together, since 4 * the area of ABE is equal to the total area of triangle ABC and is also equal to 8 times the area of ABE, we can deduce the final value of x.\n\nThe answer is x = 2.",

There is an error in the previous steps because the central angle's measure directly gives us the degree of ∠OAC due to the parallel lines AO and BC creating alternate interior angles with line segment OB.\n\nCorrect Step 8: Since AO ∥ BC, ∠OAC is equal to ∠OBC as they are alternate interior angles.

    "solution": "Step 1: Identify the known information from the question and the given diagram. We are given a circle with center O and a radius of 2 units. Angle C measures 30 degrees. Radius OD forms a 75-degree angle with chord AB.\n\nStep 2: Determine the relationship between the angles and sides in the circle. Since ∠COD is an angle emanating from the center to a chord, it subtends two equal angles on the circle's circumference (angle CAB and angle CDB).\n\nStep 3: Given that angle C is 30 degrees and OD creates a 75-degree angle with AB, we can determine angle COD is actually twice the angle CAB because angles at the center of a circle are twice angles at the circumference on the same arc. Therefore, ∠CAB is half of 75 degrees which is 37.5 degrees.\n\nStep 4: Now we have a triangle CAB with angle C being 30 degrees and angle CAB being 37.5 degrees. Since the sum of angles in a triangle equals 180 degrees, angle CBA can be calculated. Angle CBA = 180 - 30 - 37.5 = 112.5 degrees.\n\nStep 5: Use the Law of Cosines to solve for the length of AB since we have a triangle and the angles opposed to it. The formula is AB^2 = AC^2 + CB^2 - 2(AC)(CB)cos(CBA).\n\nStep 6: Plug in the values: AC and CB are both radii of the circle, so AC = CB = 2 units. Angle CBA is 112.5 degrees. So, AB^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 - 2(2)(2)cos(112.5 degrees).\n\nStep 7: Calculate using the known values: AB^2 = 4 + 4 - 16*cos(112.5 degrees).\n\nStep 8: Since the cosine of an angle greater than 90 degrees is negative, and since we are subtracting this value, AB^2 will include the addition of this positive value. Without a calculator, we cannot compute the exact value, but the cosine of 112.5 degrees is approximately -0.3827.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, AB^2 ≈ 8 - 16*(-0.3827) = 8 + 16*0.3827.\n\nStep 10: Complete the arithmetic operation: AB^2 ≈ 8 + 6.1232 which gives AB^2 ≈ 14.1232.\n\nStep 11: Since we are interested in the length of AB and not AB^2, we take the square root of 14.1232 to get the length of AB. AB ≈ √14.1232.\n\nStep 12: Provide the final approximate length of AB, which would be closest to the square root value of the sum calculated. AB ≈ √14.1232 ≈ 3.76 units.\n\nThe answer is AB ≈ 3.76 units.",

    "solution": "Step 1: 识别给定信息。已知半径为x的圆O，弦AB的长度为2，以及∠C为30°。\nStep 2: 确定相关的几何规则。在圆中，通过圆心的线段（半径）垂直于弦的中点将弦二等分。\nStep 3: 利用圆的性质确认OC垂直于AB，并将AB二等分于点D。此时，OD是半径，长度为x，AD是弦AB的一半，长度为1。\nStep 4: 观察到∆ODC形成一个直角三角形，其中∠C为30°，OD为斜边，CD为对边。\nStep 5: 应用特殊角的三角函数关系知道在30°的直角三角形中，对边与斜边的比值是1:2。\nStep 6: 因此，CD的长度为x/2。\nStep 7: 知道OC为半径，长度为x，OD为半径，也是x，计算DC为半径与OD的差，即x - x/2 = x/2。\nStep 8: 因为在直角三角形∆ODC中，OD为斜边，CD为对边，可以用Pythagoras定理表示为 OC^2 = OD^2 - CD^2。\nStep 9: 代入已知的长度，得到 x^2 = x^2 - (x/2)^2。\nStep 10: 简化得到 x^2 = x^2 - x^2/4。\nStep 11: 将方程变形为 x^2/4 = 0。\nStep 12: 解得 x = 0，但这与题目中半径为正值的假设矛盾，因此我们需要重新检查我们的计算过程。\nStep 13: 重新审视直角三角形∆ODC，我们有OC = x，OD = x，CD = x/2。代入Pythagoras定理应该是 OC^2 = OD^2 + CD^2。\nStep 14: 正确代入长度得到 x^2 = x^2 + (x/2)^2。\nStep 15: 计算得到 0 = x^2/4，这意味着 x^2 = 0，但这又与半径为正值的假设矛盾。\nStep 16: 我们可能在应用Pythagoras定理时犯了错误。在直角三角形∆ODC中，OD和DC是两条直角边，OC是斜边。正确的应用是 OC^2 = OD^2 + DC^2。\nStep 17: 代入已知的长度，得到 x^2 = x^2 + (x/2)^2。\nStep 18: 简化得到 0 = (x/2)^2。\nStep 19: 解得 x/2 = 0，这意味着 x = 0，但这又与半径为正值的假设矛盾。我们的假设里可能存在问题。\nStep 20: 我们需要重新审视问题和图形。我们忽略了三角形ODC并不是一个30°-60°-90°三角形，因为点D并不在弦AB的中点。\n\n正确的步骤应该是：\n\nStep 1: 识别给定信息。半径x，弦AB长度为2，∠C为30°。\nStep 2: 分析图形，根据∠C为30°，可以确定ODC是一个等腰三角形，因为OD和OC都是半径。\nStep 3: 确定ODC是等边三角形，因为两个角都是30°，第三个角也是30°（等腰三角形底角相等，且三角形内角和为180°）。\nStep 4: 由于ODC是等边三角形，因此OD=DC=OC=x。\nStep 5: 因为∠C是30°，所以∠DOB是60°。\nStep 6: 现在我们有一个DOB三角形，它是一个30°-60°-90°三角形，其中DB是最长边，即斜边。\nStep 7: 在30°-60°-90°三角形中，最长边（斜边）是最短边（对30°角的边）的两倍。\nStep 8: AB是弦，BD是AB的一半，所以BD=AB/2=1。\nStep 9: DB作为斜边，是BD的两倍，所以DB=2*BD=2*1=2。\nStep 10: 因为DB是半径，所以DB=x。\nStep 11: 从而我们得出x=2。\n\n答案是x的值是2。",

    "solution": "Step 1: Understand the concept of similar triangles. Similar triangles have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Their corresponding sides are proportional, and their corresponding angles are equal.\n\nStep 2: Identify the triangles that are similar. We have $\\triangle DEF \\sim \\triangle CBF$.\n\nStep 3: List the known side lengths. We know $DF = 6$ and $FC = 8$. Since $\\triangle DEF \\sim \\triangle CBF$, the side $DF$ of $\\triangle DEF$ is corresponding to side $FC$ of $\\triangle CBF$.\n\nStep 4: Compute the scale factor. To find the scale factor between the similar triangles, divide one of the known corresponding sides by the other. So the scale factor $k = \\frac{DF}{FC} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nStep 5: Determine the unknown sides. We need to find the lengths of $DE$ and $EF$. These will be in the same ratio as $DF$ to $FC$.\n\nStep 6: Use the perimeter of $\\triangle CBF$ to find the remaining side. The perimeter of $\\triangle CBF$ is given as 27. We have $FC=8$ and need to find $BF$ and $BC$. Let's denote the length of $BF$ as $b$ and the length of $BC$ as $c$. The perimeter is the sum of the sides, so we have $8 + b + c = 27$.\n\nStep 7: Solve the equation for $b+c$. From the equation, $b + c = 27 - 8 = 19$. Unfortunately, without more information, we cannot find the exact lengths of $BF$ and $BC$ separately, but we can express one in terms of the other, such as $b = 19 - c$.\n\nStep 8: Apply the scale factor to find the sides of $\\triangle DEF$. If we denote the lengths of $DE$ as $d$ and $EF$ as $f$, because the triangles are similar, they must satisfy $d = k \\cdot c$ and $f = k \\cdot b$ where $k$ is the scale factor found in Step 4.\n\nStep 9: Use the scale factor to find the perimeter of $\\triangle DEF$. The perimeter of $\\triangle DEF$ is $d + f + DF$. Using the scale factor, we get $d = k \\cdot c$, $f = k \\cdot b$, and we know $DF = 6$.\n\nStep 10: Express the perimeter of $\\triangle DEF$ using known variables. The perimeter $P_{DEF} = d + f + 6 = k \\cdot c + k \\cdot b + 6 = k \\cdot (b + c) + 6$.\n\nStep 11: Substitute the values of $k$, $b+c$, and $DF$. We have $k = \\frac{3}{4}$ and $b + c = 19$. So, $P_{DEF} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 19 + 6$.\n\nStep 12: Calculate the perimeter of $\\triangle DEF$. Performing the calculation, $P_{DEF} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 19 + 6 = \\frac{57}{4} + 6 = 14.25 + 6 = 20.25$.\n\nThe answer is 20.25.",

Since $\\triangle DEF \\sim \\triangle CBF$, the side $DF$ of $\\triangle DEF$ is corresponding to side $FC$ of $\\triangle CBF$.\n\nStep 4: Compute the scale factor. To find the scale factor between the similar triangles, divide one of the known corresponding sides by the other. So the scale factor $k = \\frac{DF}{FC} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nStep 5: Determine the unknown sides. We need to find the lengths of $DE$ and $EF$. These will be in the same ratio as $DF$ to $FC$.\n\nStep 6: Use the perimeter of $\\triangle CBF$ to find the remaining side. The perimeter of $\\triangle CBF$ is given as 27. We have $FC=8$ and need to find $BF$ and $BC$. Let's denote the length of $BF$ as $b$ and the length of $BC$ as $c$. The perimeter is the sum of the sides, so we have $8 + b + c = 27$.\n\nStep 7: Solve the equation for $b+c$. From the equation, $b + c = 27 - 8 = 19$. Unfortunately, without more information, we cannot find the exact lengths of $BF$ and $BC$ separately, but we can express one in terms of the other, such as $b = 19 - c$.\n\nStep 8: Apply the scale factor to find the sides of $\\triangle DEF$. If we denote the lengths of $DE$ as $d$ and $EF$ as $f$, because the triangles are similar, they must satisfy $d = k \\cdot c$ and $f = k \\cdot (c - 8)$ where $k$ is the scale factor found in Step 4.\n\nStep 9: Use the scale factor to find the perimeter of $\\triangle DEF$. The perimeter of $\\triangle DEF$ is $d + f + DF$. Using the scale factor, we get $d = k \\cdot c$, $f = k \\cdot (c - 8)$, and we know $DF = 6$.\n\nStep 10: Express the perimeter of $\\triangle DEF$ using known variables. The perimeter $P_{DEF} = d + f + 6 = k \\cdot c + k \\cdot (c - 8) + 6$.\n\nStep 11: Substitute the values of $k$, $b+c$, and $DF$. We have $k = \\frac{3}{4}$ and $b + c = 19$. So, $P_{DEF} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot c + \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot (c - 8) + 6$.\n\nStep 12: Calculate the perimeter of $\\triangle DEF$. Performing the calculation, $P_{DEF} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot c + \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot (c - 8) + 6 = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 19 + \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 11 + 6 = 14.25 + 8.25 + 6 = 28.5$.\n\nThe answer is 28.5.",

    "solution": "Step 1: Recognize that the areas of the equilateral triangles are proportional to the square of their sides.\nStep 2: Realize that triangle A'BC has an area of 10, and AB'C has an area of 4, which implies that the side of triangle A'BC is √10 times the length of the side of triangle AB'C.\nStep 3: Understand that the sides of the equilateral triangles are congruent to the sides of the right-angled triangle ABC they are constructed on.\nStep 4: Use the fact that the sides of the two known equilateral triangles are proportional to the sides of the right triangle, the larger side of ABC corresponds to A'BC and the smaller to AB'C.\nStep 5: Calculate the ratio of the sides of ABC by squaring the areas (since area is proportional to the square of the side of an equilateral triangle), which gives: √10 / √4 = √(10/4) = √(5/2) which simplifies to √2.5.\nStep 6: This means that the ratio of the hypotenuse to the smaller side of triangle ABC is √2.5:1.\nStep 7: Since the area of the triangle is proportional to the square of its side, and knowing the ratio of the sides, square the ratio to find the ratio of the areas, which would be (√2.5)^2:1^2 = 2.5:1.\nStep 8: Multiply the area of the smaller triangle by this ratio to find the area of the equilateral triangle on the hypotenuse, which is 4 * 2.5 = 10.\n\nThe answer is: The area of the equilateral triangle ABC' is 10.",

    "solution": "Step 1: 标记矩形的宽AB为2，由于ABCD是矩形，因此AD和BC也等于2。\nStep 2: ∠AOB为60°，并且由于O是对角线的交点，故三角形AOB为等边三角形。\nStep 3: 因此，AO和OB的长度也等于AB，即AO=OB=2。\nStep 4: 由于矩形的对角线互相平分，所以OC=OD=AO=2。\nStep 5: 因此，BD作为对角线可以分为两部分，BO和OD。\nStep 6: 由于BO和OD都等于2，所以BD=BO+OD=2+2=4。\n\nThe answer is BD的长为4。",

Angles 1 and 5, as well as angles 14 and 10, are alternate interior angles.\n\nStep 3: Since $m∠1 = x$, and $m∠14 = 57°$, and angles 1 and 5 are alternate interior angles, it follows that $m∠5 = x$ as well.\n\nStep 4: As angles 14 and 10 are also alternate interior angles, this means $m∠10 = m∠14 = 57°$.\n\nStep 5: Angles 5 and 10 are on the same straight line, making them supplementary angles. This means that $m∠5 + m∠10 = 180°$.\n\nStep 6: Substitute the known values into the equation from step 5: $x + 57° = 180°$.\n\nStep 7: Solve for x by subtracting 57° from both sides of the equation: $x = 180° - 57°$.\n\nStep 8: Complete the calculation: $x = 123°$.\n\nThe answer is $x = 123°$.",

Therefore, if AC (the hypotenuse of the triangle ABC) is 3.0, then AB (the side opposite the 60-degree angle) is half of that, so AB = AC/2 = 3.0/2 = 1.5.\n\nStep 5: Recall that the rhombus has four sides of equal length, so the perimeter of the rhombus is 4 times the length of one side.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the perimeter by multiplying the length of one side by 4: Perimeter = 4 * AB = 4 * 1.5.\n\nStep 7: Finish the calculation: Perimeter = 4 * 1.5 = 6.\n\nThe answer is 6.0.",

    "solution": "Step 1: Acknowledge the given information from the question and the diagram:\n- AB is bisected perpendicularly at D, and this perpendicular line meets BC at E.\n- AB = 6 units\n- Distance from D to BC is 2 units, which is the length of DE since DE is perpendicular to BC.\n- The perimeter of ΔACE is given as 13 units.\n\nStep 2: Use the properties of the perpendicular bisector and the given lengths to find AE and EC.\n- Since AB is 6 units and D bisects it, DB = 3 units.\n- AE comprises AD (which is equal to DB) and DE. So, AE = DB + DE = 3 + 2 = 5 units.\n\nStep 3: Determine the perimeter of ΔABC using the perimeter of ΔACE.\n- We have AE = 5 units and the perimeter of ΔACE as 13 units.\n- To find EC, subtract AE from the perimeter of ΔACE and then add AC to get the perimeter of ΔABC.\n- Let's find EC first: Perimeter of ΔACE - AE = 13 units - 5 units = 8 units.\n\nStep 4: Notice that EC is a part of both ΔACE and ΔABC.\n- Since EC is shared by both triangles, when we add AB and BC (to get the perimeter of ΔABC), we don't need to add EC again.\n- Let's find BC now. Since triangle ABC is not given as isosceles or equilateral, we cannot make assumptions about the sides based on DE being 2 units. However, because DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, and triangles ADE and CDE are congruent (by reflection across DE), EC is also equal to AE.\n- Thus, EC, which we have found to be 8 units, is also equal to CE.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the perimeter of ΔABC.\n- Perimeter of ΔABC = AB + BC + AC\n- Since AB = 6 units, and EC = CE = 8 units (determined from the perimeter of ΔACE), we now know:\nBC = CE + BE (BE is the same length as AB since DE bisects AB perpendicularly and thus AB and BE are reflections of each other across DE).\nBC = 8 + 6 = 14 units.\n\nStep 6: Finally, add AB, BC and AC to find the perimeter of ΔABC.\n- AB is 6 units, BC (which we found in Step 5) is 14 units, and AC (which is the same as EC) is 8 units.\n\nThe answer is: Perimeter of ΔABC = AB + BC + AC = 6 + 14 + 8 = 28 units.",

Therefore, there must be a mistake in the premises or the interpretation of the drawing. \n\nStep 9: Adjust the assumption to reflect a consistent understanding of the parallelogram. Since the drawing cannot be relied upon for exact measurements and may not be to scale, deduce logically without relying on the scale of the drawing.\n\nStep 10: Because BC = AD and AD = 6, BC must also be 6. With this corrected information, it follows that BD = BC, meaning BD is also 6.\n\nStep 11: Given that BD = BE + ED and that ED = BE (from the congruent triangles established in step 3), set up the equation: 6 = BE + BE (or, 6 = 2 * BE).\n\nStep 12: Solve for BE by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, giving BE = 6 / 2.\n\nStep 13: Calculate the value of BE, which is 3.\n\nThe answer is BE = 3.",

    "image": "images/935.jpg",
    "solution": "Step 1: Note that ABCD is a parallelogram, which means that opposite sides are equal in length. Therefore, AD = BC = 6 units and AB = CD = 4 units.\nStep 2: Recognize that DE bisects angle ADC. Therefore, angle ADE is congruent to angle EDC.\nStep 3: Since ADC is a straight angle, it measures 180 degrees. Therefore, angle ADE and angle EDC each measure 90 degrees because they are congruent and together sum to 180 degrees.\nStep 4: Considering triangle CDE is a right-angled triangle (because of the 90-degree angle at point E), using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can calculate the length of DE if it is required to find BE.\n\nHowever, since DE is not necessary to find BE, we can directly infer that the length of BE is the difference between BC and CE.\n\nStep 5: Triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC by the Angle-Angle similarity postulate, since they both share angle A, and we have established that angle ADE is congruent to angle ABC (because they both are 90 degrees due to DE being an angle bisector and ABCD is a parallelogram).\n\nStep 6: The similarity ratio can be established by comparing the lengths of corresponding sides AB and AD. AB/AD = 4/6 = 2/3.\n\nStep 7: Since the triangles are similar by a ratio of 2/3, and BC = 6 units (same length as AD), then CE must be 2/3 of BC (because CE corresponds to AB in the smaller triangle while BC corresponds to AD in the larger triangle).\n\nStep 8: Calculate CE: CE = 2/3 * BC = 2/3 * 6 = 4 units.\n\nStep 9: Since BE is the remaining part of BC that is not CE, we calculate BE: BE = BC - CE = 6 - 4 = 2 units.\n\nThe answer is 2 units.",

    "image": "images/935.jpg",
    "solution": "Step 1: Identify given measurements from the information provided. AD equals 6 units, AB equals 4 units, and DC is 2 units shorter than AD.\nStep 2: Calculate the length of DC. Since AD equals 6 units and DC is 2 units shorter, DC equals 6 - 2, which is 4 units.\nStep 3: Recognize that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Therefore, if DE bisects angle ADC, it means point E is the midpoint of BC.\nStep 4: Understand that the parallelogram can be divided into two congruent triangles, ΔADE and ΔBCE, by the diagonal AC. Therefore, AE equals CE, and DE is common for both triangles.\nStep 5: Since AE equals CE and AD equals DC (both are 4 units from Step 2), triangles ΔADE and ΔBCE are congruent by the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) postulate. Because these triangles are congruent, we also know that BE equals AE.\nStep 6: To find the length of AE, we can consider triangle ΔADC. Since E bisects angle ADC, AE is half of the length of AC.\nStep 7: Find the length of AC using the Pythagorean theorem in ΔADC, where AD equals 6 units and CD equals 4 units. AC² = AD² + CD², which means AC² = 6² + 4², so AC² = 36 + 16, which means AC² = 52.\nStep 8: Calculate AC by taking the square root of 52. AC = √52, which can be simplified to AC = √(4*13) = 2√13.\nStep 9: Since AE is half of AC, and AC equals 2√13, AE equals 2√13 / 2, which simplifies to AE equals √13.\nStep 10: As established in Step 5, BE equals AE. Therefore, BE also equals √13.\n\nThe answer is BE equals √13.",

    "solution": "Step 1: Identify the given information from the question and the diagram. We know that the measure of arc PQ, denoted by \\( m \\widehat {PQ} \\), is given as 49 degrees.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that \\( m \\widehat {PQR} \\), which we can denote as \\( x \\), refers to the measure of arc PQR in circle S, essentially the angle subtended by arc PQR at the center of the circle.\n\nStep 3: Observe the diagram and identify that arc PQR is made up of arc PQ and arc QR, and since PQ is a semicircle (which is 180 degrees), the measure of arc PQR (angle x) would be this 180 degrees minus arc PQ, which is 49 degrees.\n\nStep 4: Subtract the measure of arc PQ from 180 degrees to find the measure of arc PQR. This can be represented mathematically by \\( x = 180 - 49 \\). \n\nStep 5: Perform the subtraction to solve for \\( x \\). This equates to \\( x = 131 \\).\n\nThe answer is \\( x = 131 \\) degrees.",

    "solution": "Step 1: Calculate the sum of the ratios given for the angles. The sum is 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.\nStep 2: Divide the full angle at O, which is 360°, by the sum of the ratios to find the value of one part. So, one part is 360° / 9 = 40°.\nStep 3: Use the value of one part to find the angle measure of ∠AOB by multiplying the ratio for ∠AOB, which is 2, by the value of one part. So, ∠AOB = 2 * 40° = 80°.\nStep 4: Rays OM and ON bisect ∠AOB and ∠COD respectively, so ∠MOB = ∠AOB / 2 and ∠CON = ∠COD / 2. Since ∠AOB = 80° and the ratio for ∠COD is twice that of ∠AOB, we can calculate ∠COD as 4 * 40° = 160°.\nStep 5: With ∠COD being 160°, bisected by ON, then ∠CON would be 160° / 2 = 80°.\nStep 6: Now we know ∠MOB = 40° (since it is half of ∠AOB) and ∠CON = 80°. These two angles combine to form ∠MON. Since ∠MON is given as 84°, we have ∠MON = ∠MOB + ∠CON.\nStep 7: We have already found that ∠MOB = 40° (from step 4) and ∠CON = 80° (from step 5). However, we have a discrepancy, as adding these two should equal ∠MON, which is stated to be 84°. There seems to be an issue with the provided angle measure or the given problem setup since our calculated values would sum to 120°.\nStep 8: We need to re-examine the problem statement or the given angle (∠MON) for any possible errors or typos.\nStep 9: Assuming all given information is correct except the measure of ∠MON, we would proceed as such: Since ∠MOB and ∠CON are both half of their original angles, we add them together and see if they equal the given ∠MON. But as mentioned, the sum of 40° and 80° is 120°, not 84°.\n\nThe discrepancy suggests an error in the problem as presented. With consistent values, considering the steps taken and the issue at step 6 and 7, I'm unable to provide a correct final angle measure for ∠AOB that aligns with the given value of ∠MON being 84°. The calculated value for ∠AOB was 80° based on the original problem parameters.\n\nThe answer is... the information given seems inconsistent, but based on the initial ratios, ∠AOB should be 80°. However, this does not reconcile with the given ∠MON of 84°.",

Therefore, 2x + 3x + 4x = 9x = 180 degrees.\nStep 4: Solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 9, so x = 180 / 9 = 20 degrees.\nStep 5: Calculate the measure of ∠AOB using the value of x, ∠AOB = 2x = 2 * 20 degrees = 40 degrees.\nStep 6: Since OM bisects ∠AOB, half of ∠AOB will be ∠AOM, which is ∠AOB / 2 = 40 degrees / 2 = 20 degrees.\nStep 7: Similarly, since ON bisects ∠COD and ∠COD = 4x = 4 * 20 degrees = 80 degrees, half of ∠COD will be ∠CON, which is ∠COD / 2 = 80 degrees / 2 = 40 degrees.\nStep 8: Add ∠AOM and ∠CON to get ∠MON, which is already given as 84 degrees. So, ∠MON = ∠AOM + ∠CON = 20 degrees + 40 degrees = 60 degrees.\nStep 9: Since there is a discrepancy because the given ∠MON is 84 degrees, not 60 degrees, we need to check our calculation. It looks like a possible misunderstanding in the steps might have led to an incorrect conclusion. Let's correct this.\nStep 10: Realize that ∠MON is actually composed of half of ∠AOB and half of ∠COD. If ∠MON = 84 degrees, then the sum of half of ∠AOB and half of ∠COD must equal 84 degrees. Therefore, (2x/2) + (4x/2) = x + 2x = 3x must equal 84 degrees.\nStep 11: Solve for x in the equation 3x = 84 degrees by dividing both sides by 3, so x = 84 degrees / 3 = 28 degrees.\nStep 12: Recalculate the measure of ∠AOB using the correct value of x, which is ∠AOB = 2x = 2 * 28 degrees = 56 degrees.\n\nThe answer is 56 degrees.",

    "solution": "Step 1: Recognize that the ratios given for ∠AOB, ∠BOC, and ∠COD add up to 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 parts.\nStep 2: Since ∠AOB is given as 28°, and this represents 2 parts of the ratio, calculate the value of one part (which will be used to find the values of the other angles): 28° / 2 = 14°.\nStep 3: Use the value of one part to calculate the measures of ∠BOC and ∠COD: ∠BOC = 3 parts = 3 * 14° = 42°, and ∠COD = 4 parts = 4 * 14° = 56°.\nStep 4: Since OM bisects ∠AOB, the measure of ∠AOM is half of ∠AOB: ∠AOM = ∠AOB / 2 = 28° / 2 = 14°.\nStep 5: Since ON bisects ∠COD, the measure of ∠CON is half of ∠COD: ∠CON = ∠COD / 2 = 56° / 2 = 28°.\nStep 6: Now calculate the measure of ∠MON, which is the sum of ∠AOM and ∠CON (because those angles are adjacent and add up to ∠MON): ∠MON = ∠AOM + ∠CON = 14° + 28° = 42°.\nStep 7: Therefore, the value of x, which represents the measure of ∠MON, is 42°.\n\nThe answer is x = 42°.",

    "solution": "Step 1: The problem states that the ratios of the angles ∠AOB:∠BOC:∠COD are 2:3:4.\n\nStep 2: Let y be the common ratio factor for the angles. Therefore, ∠AOB = 2y, ∠BOC = 3y, and ∠COD = 4y.\n\nStep 3: Since ∠AOB = 28°, so y = 7°.\n\nStep 4: Since OM, ON bisecting Angle COD and Angle COD, we can write the equation y + 3y + 2y = ∠MON.\n\nStep 4: Combine like terms to simplify the equation: ∠MON = 6y = 42 degrees.\n\nThe answer is ∠MON = 42 degrees.",
