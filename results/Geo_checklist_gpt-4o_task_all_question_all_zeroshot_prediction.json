Therefore, all sides of the rhombus ABCD are 5 units.\n\nSince E and F are midpoints of AB and AD, respectively, segments AE and AF are each half the length of AB and AD. Thus, AE = AF = 2.5 units.\n\nIn a rhombus, the line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides (EF in this case) is parallel to the other two sides and is half the length of the diagonal connecting those two sides. However, since we are not given the lengths of the diagonals or any angles, we cannot directly calculate the length of EF using the given information alone.\n\nTherefore, the problem does not provide sufficient information to determine the length of segment EF.\n\nThe answer is: Unanswerable"

Therefore:\n- ∠AOD = x\n- ∠DOE = x\n- ∠AOE = 2x\n\nNow, we need to find the measure of ∠EOB:\n- ∠EOB = ∠AOB - ∠AOE = 130 degrees - 2x.\n\nHowever, without the measure of ∠AOE or the value of x, we cannot determine the exact measure of ∠EOB.\n\nThe answer is: Unanswerable."

Since AB = AC, triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = AC.\n2. The angle at point B, ∠ABC, is given as 65 degrees.\n3. In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. Therefore, ∠BAC = ∠BCA.\n4. The sum of the angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees.

Let the area of triangle ABE be x; thus, the area of triangle ADE is also x.\nStep 5: Because D is the midpoint of BC, triangle ADB has the same base length as triangle ADC, and they share the same height from A.\nStep 6: Thus, the area of triangle ADB is equal to the area of triangle ADC.\nStep 7: The area of triangle ABE is ½ the area of triangle ADB (since E is the midpoint of AD). If the area of triangle ABE is x, the area of triangle ADB is 2x.\nStep 8: Similarly, the area of triangle ADC is also 2x.\nStep 9: The total area of triangle ABC is the sum of the areas of triangles ADB and ADC, which is 2x + 2x.\nStep 10: Add the areas for the whole triangle: 2x + 2x = 4x.\nStep 11: Now, we know that the area of triangle ABC is given to be 8 times the area of triangle ABE, which is 8x.\nStep 12: Equate the two expressions for the area of triangle ABC: 4x = 8x.\n\nMissing some steps to solve the problem. Let's continue:\nStep 13: Since the total area of triangle ABC is made up of the areas of triangles ADE, ADB, and ADC (with ADE already established as x and ADB + ADC together known to be equal to 4x), we need to establish the ratio of the areas correctly.\nStep 14: Note that triangle ABE constitutes one part of the four equal parts into which triangle ABC is divided by segments AD and BE.\nStep 15: That means the area of triangle ABE is 1/4 of the total area of triangle ABC.\nStep 16: If the area of triangle ABE is x, then the total area of triangle ABC is 4 * x, or 4x.\nStep 17: The given total area is 8 times the area of triangle ABE, hence the total area of triangle ABC is also 8x.\nStep 18: Setting the two expressions for the total area of triangle ABC to be equal, we have 4x = 8x.\nStep 19: This is a contradiction because it would require x to be 0 for equality to hold, which doesn't make sense in the context of the area of a triangle.\nStep 20: Realize the mistake in step 18. Since we established that the area of triangle ABE is x and it's 1/4 of the total area of triangle ABC, we should multiply x by 4 to find the total area.\nStep 21: So, the correct total area of triangle ABC is 4 * x = 4x, which we are told is equal to 8 times the area of triangle ABE.\nStep 22: Therefore, 4x should be set equal to 8x, where x represents the area of triangle ABE.\nStep 23: Upon reevaluating, it's clear that there has been a misunderstanding in the initial steps. The area of triangle ABC is actually made up of two areas of 4x each (from triangle ADB and triangle ADC), not two of 2x each. Let's correct this.\nStep 24: Hence, we should summarize that triangle ABC is divided equally into four triangles of equal area by its medians: ABE, ADE, BDC, and ADC.\nStep 25: Each of these four triangles has an area of x, as established for triangle ABE.\nStep 26: To find the area of triangle ABC, we multiply the area of one of the smaller triangles (x) by 4, since there are four of them.\nStep 27: Therefore, the correct relationship is 4x = the area of triangle ABC.\nStep 28: We are given that the area of triangle ABC is 8 times the area of triangle ABE, so we substitute in the value of 8x for the area of triangle ABC.\nStep 29: Aligning the two expressions, we now have 4x = 8x for the total area of triangle ABC, which must be a mistake.\nStep 30: Correcting the error, we should compare the number of triangle ABE areas in triangle ABC to what is given. There are four such areas in triangle ABC as each of the four triangles within ABC is equal in area to ABE.\nStep 31: Therefore, the correct expression would be 4 * the area of ABE = the total area of triangle ABC.\nStep 32: The given information states that the total area of triangle ABC is 8 times the area of ABE, hence 8 * the area of ABE = the total area of triangle ABC.\nStep 33: Putting it all together, since 4 * the area of ABE is equal to the total area of triangle ABC and is also equal to 8 times the area of ABE, we can deduce the final value of x.\n\nThe answer is x = 2.",

        "solution": "Step 1: Identify the known information from the question and the given diagram. We are given a circle with center O and a radius of 2 units. Angle C measures 30 degrees. Radius OD forms a 75-degree angle with chord AB.\n\nStep 2: Determine the relationship between the angles and sides in the circle. Since ∠COD is an angle emanating from the center to a chord, it subtends two equal angles on the circle's circumference (angle CAB and angle CDB).\n\nStep 3: Given that angle C is 30 degrees and OD creates a 75-degree angle with AB, we can determine angle COD is actually twice the angle CAB because angles at the center of a circle are twice angles at the circumference on the same arc. Therefore, ∠CAB is half of 75 degrees which is 37.5 degrees.\n\nStep 4: Now we have a triangle CAB with angle C being 30 degrees and angle CAB being 37.5 degrees. Since the sum of angles in a triangle equals 180 degrees, angle CBA can be calculated. Angle CBA = 180 - 30 - 37.5 = 112.5 degrees.\n\nStep 5: Use the Law of Cosines to solve for the length of AB since we have a triangle and the angles opposed to it. The formula is AB^2 = AC^2 + CB^2 - 2(AC)(CB)cos(CBA).\n\nStep 6: Plug in the values: AC and CB are both radii of the circle, so AC = CB = 2 units. Angle CBA is 112.5 degrees. So, AB^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 - 2(2)(2)cos(112.5 degrees).\n\nStep 7: Calculate using the known values: AB^2 = 4 + 4 - 16*cos(112.5 degrees).\n\nStep 8: Since the cosine of an angle greater than 90 degrees is negative, and since we are subtracting this value, AB^2 will include the addition of this positive value. Without a calculator, we cannot compute the exact value, but the cosine of 112.5 degrees is approximately -0.3827.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, AB^2 ≈ 8 - 16*(-0.3827) = 8 + 16*0.3827.\n\nStep 10: Complete the arithmetic operation: AB^2 ≈ 8 + 6.1232 which gives AB^2 ≈ 14.1232.\n\nStep 11: Since we are interested in the length of AB and not AB^2, we take the square root of 14.1232 to get the length of AB. AB ≈ √14.1232.\n\nStep 12: Provide the final approximate length of AB, which would be closest to the square root value of the sum calculated. AB ≈ √14.1232 ≈ 3.76 units.\n\nThe answer is AB ≈ 3.76 units.",

        "solution": "Step 1: Acknowledge the given information from the question and the diagram:\n- AB is bisected perpendicularly at D, and this perpendicular line meets BC at E.\n- AB = 6 units\n- Distance from D to BC is 2 units, which is the length of DE since DE is perpendicular to BC.\n- The perimeter of ΔACE is given as 13 units.\n\nStep 2: Use the properties of the perpendicular bisector and the given lengths to find AE and EC.\n- Since AB is 6 units and D bisects it, DB = 3 units.\n- AE comprises AD (which is equal to DB) and DE. So, AE = DB + DE = 3 + 2 = 5 units.\n\nStep 3: Determine the perimeter of ΔABC using the perimeter of ΔACE.\n- We have AE = 5 units and the perimeter of ΔACE as 13 units.\n- To find EC, subtract AE from the perimeter of ΔACE and then add AC to get the perimeter of ΔABC.\n- Let's find EC first: Perimeter of ΔACE - AE = 13 units - 5 units = 8 units.\n\nStep 4: Notice that EC is a part of both ΔACE and ΔABC.\n- Since EC is shared by both triangles, when we add AB and BC (to get the perimeter of ΔABC), we don't need to add EC again.\n- Let's find BC now. Since triangle ABC is not given as isosceles or equilateral, we cannot make assumptions about the sides based on DE being 2 units. However, because DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, and triangles ADE and CDE are congruent (by reflection across DE), EC is also equal to AE.\n- Thus, EC, which we have found to be 8 units, is also equal to CE.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the perimeter of ΔABC.\n- Perimeter of ΔABC = AB + BC + AC\n- Since AB = 6 units, and EC = CE = 8 units (determined from the perimeter of ΔACE), we now know:\nBC = CE + BE (BE is the same length as AB since DE bisects AB perpendicularly and thus AB and BE are reflections of each other across DE).\nBC = 8 + 6 = 14 units.\n\nStep 6: Finally, add AB, BC and AC to find the perimeter of ΔABC.\n- AB is 6 units, BC (which we found in Step 5) is 14 units, and AC (which is the same as EC) is 8 units.\n\nThe answer is: Perimeter of ΔABC = AB + BC + AC = 6 + 14 + 8 = 28 units.",

Since AD equals 6 units and DC is 2 units shorter, DC equals 6 - 2, which is 4 units.\nStep 3: Recognize that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Therefore, if DE bisects angle ADC, it means point E is the midpoint of BC.\nStep 4: Understand that the parallelogram can be divided into two congruent triangles, ΔADE and ΔBCE, by the diagonal AC. Therefore, AE equals CE, and DE is common for both triangles.\nStep 5: Since AE equals CE and AD equals DC (both are 4 units from Step 2), triangles ΔADE and ΔBCE are congruent by the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) postulate. Because these triangles are congruent, we also know that BE equals AE.\nStep 6: To find the length of AE, we can consider triangle ΔADC. Since E bisects angle ADC, AE is half of the length of AC.\nStep 7: Find the length of AC using the Pythagorean theorem in ΔADC, where AD equals 6 units and CD equals 4 units. AC² = AD² + CD², which means AC² = 6² + 4², so AC² = 36 + 16, which means AC² = 52.\nStep 8: Calculate AC by taking the square root of 52. AC = √52, which can be simplified to AC = √(4*13) = 2√13.\nStep 9: Since AE is half of AC, and AC equals 2√13, AE equals 2√13 / 2, which simplifies to AE equals √13.\nStep 10: As established in Step 5, BE equals AE.

So, ∠AOB = 2 * 40° = 80°.\nStep 4: Rays OM and ON bisect ∠AOB and ∠COD respectively, so ∠MOB = ∠AOB / 2 and ∠CON = ∠COD / 2.

Therefore, 2x + 3x + 4x = 9x = 180 degrees.\nStep 4: Solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 9, so x = 180 / 9 = 20 degrees.\nStep 5: Calculate the measure of ∠AOB using the value of x, ∠AOB = 2x = 2 * 20 degrees = 40 degrees.\nStep 6: Since OM bisects ∠AOB, half of ∠AOB will be ∠AOM, which is ∠AOB / 2 = 40 degrees / 2 = 20 degrees.\nStep 7: Similarly, since ON bisects ∠COD and ∠COD = 4x = 4 * 20 degrees = 80 degrees, half of ∠COD will be ∠CON, which is ∠COD / 2 = 80 degrees / 2 = 40 degrees.\nStep 8: Add ∠AOM and ∠CON to get ∠MON, which is already given as 84 degrees.
