Therefore, ∠OBC + ∠OCB = 180° - 145°.\nStep 4: Calculate the sum of ∠OBC and ∠OCB, which is 180° - 145° = 35°.\nStep 5: Since OB and OC are angle bisectors, ∠OBC and ∠OCB are each half of angles B and C of the triangle. So, angle B plus angle C equals 2 * 35° = 70°.\nStep 6: Now, using the sum of interior angles of a triangle, which is 180°, we have angle A + angle B + angle C = 180°.\nStep 7: We know angle B + angle C = 70°, so angle A = 180° - 70°.\nStep 8: Calculate the value of angle A, which is 180° - 70° = 110°.\n\nThe answer is x = 110°.",

        "solution": "Step 1: Identify that E and F are the midpoints of the sides AB and AD respectively in the rhombus ABCD.\nStep 2: Understand that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right-angled triangle AOB (where AO is one leg, BO is the other leg, and AB is the hypotenuse), calculate BO.\nStep 5: Apply the Pythagorean theorem: AB^2 = AO^2 + BO^2, which translates to 5^2 = 3^2 + BO^2.\nStep 6: Simplify the equation: 25 = 9 + BO^2, which leads to BO^2 = 25 - 9 = 16.\nStep 7: Solve for BO: BO = √16 = 4.\nStep 8: Since the diagonals bisect each other, BO = OD = 4.\nStep 9: EF passes through the midpoint O of the diagonal AC.

        "solution": "Step 1: Identify the original length of the elastic band, which is the distance from point A to point B, given as 16 cm.\n\nStep 2: Recognize that pulling the midpoint C to point D creates two right-angled triangles, ΔACD and ΔBCD.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the length of the base of each right-angled triangle, which is half the length of the original band, so each base is 8 cm (16 cm / 2).\n\nStep 4: The height of each triangle is given as the distance the midpoint C is pulled up to point D, which is 6 cm.\n\nStep 5: Use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the new length of each half of the band (the hypotenuse of the triangle). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). The formula is c² = a² + b².\n\nStep 6: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to one of the triangles (for example, ΔACD): c² = a² + b², where a is 8 cm and b is 6 cm.\n\nStep 7: Calculate c² = (8 cm)² + (6 cm)² = 64 cm² + 36 cm² = 100 cm².\n\nStep 8: Find the length of the hypotenuse c by taking the square root of c²: c = √100 cm² = 10 cm.\n\nStep 9: The new length of each half of the band is 10 cm. Since there are two symmetrical halves, the total new length of the band is 2 * 10 cm = 20 cm.\n\nStep 10: Determine how much longer the elastic band has been stretched by subtracting the original length from the new total length: 20 cm - 16 cm = 4 cm.\n\nThe answer is that the elastic band has been stretched by 4 cm.",

        "solution": "Step 1: Recognize that this forms two right-angled triangles, Triangle ADC and Triangle BDC.\n\nStep 2: Acknowledge that the original length of the band ACB was 16 cm, so each half, AC and CB, is 8 cm.\n\nStep 3: The vertical height (CD) from C to D is given as 6 cm.\n\nStep 4: Use the Pythagorean theorem which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a^2 + b^2 = c^2).\n\nStep 5: Apply the Pythagorean theorem to one of the right triangles, in this case, Triangle ADC. Let AD be the hypotenuse (which is half of the stretched length of the band), and let AC and CD be the other two sides. According to the theorem, AD^2 = AC^2 + CD^2.\n\nStep 6: Substitute the given values into the equation: AD^2 = 8^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100.\n\nStep 7: Take the square root of both sides to solve for AD: AD = √100 = 10 cm.\n\nStep 8: State that since we considered ADB as an isosceles triangle, the total length of the stretched band is just one side, AD, instead of AD + DB: The total length of the stretched band = 10 cm.\n\nStep 9: Calculate the difference between the stretched length and the original length: 10 cm - 16 cm = -6 cm.\n\nThe answer is: The elastic band has been stretched by an additional -6 cm.",

        "solution": "Step 1: Note that ∠AOE is bisected by OD, creating two angles of 50 degrees each.\nStep 2: Since OD bisects ∠AOE, ∠AOD = ∠DOE = 50 degrees.\nStep 3: Remember that ∠BOC is given as 50 degrees.\nStep 4: Know that ∠AOC is 80 degrees more than ∠BOC, so ∠AOC = ∠BOC + 80 degrees = 50 degrees + 80 degrees.\nStep 5: Calculate ∠AOC, which is 50 + 80 = 130 degrees.\nStep 6: ∠AOC and ∠BOC form a straight line, meaning together they sum up to 180 degrees because they are supplementary angles.\nStep 7: Based on the fact that ∠AOC and ∠BOC are supplementary, subtract the sum of ∠AOC (130 degrees) and ∠BOC (50 degrees) from 180 degrees to find ∠COE.\nStep 8: Calculate ∠COE as 180 degrees - (130 degrees + 50 degrees) = 0 degrees, which is not correct; we actually need to subtract only ∠AOC from 180 degrees because it represents the entire angle from AO to CO.\nStep 9: Recalculate ∠COE correctly as 180 degrees - 130 degrees = 50 degrees.\nStep 10: Now, we know ∠AOB = 180 degrees (it's a straight line), hence subtract ∠AOD (50 degrees) from ∠AOB (180 degrees) to get ∠DOB.\nStep 11: Calculate ∠DOB as 180 degrees - 50 degrees = 110 degrees.\nStep 12: Since we know ∠COE, and OD is a straight line, then ∠DOE is equal to ∠COE, which is 50 degrees.\nStep 13: Finally, since ∠EOB is part of the larger angle, ∠DOB, subtract ∠DOE from ∠DOB to get ∠EOB.\nStep 14: Calculate ∠EOB as ∠DOB - ∠DOE = 110 degrees - 50 degrees.\nStep 15: Complete the calculation, ∠EOB = 60 degrees.\n\nThe answer is 60 degrees.",

        "solution": "Step 1: Recognize that in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Therefore, ∠ABC is equal to ∠D, which is given as 55.0°.\n\nStep 2: Understand that in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180°. Since ∠ABC is 55.0°, ∠ABE (which is supplementary to ∠ABC) must be 180° - 55.0° = 125.0°.\n\nStep 3: Observe that triangle ABE is a right triangle because CE is perpendicular to AB. Therefore, ∠AEB is 90°.\n\nStep 4: Use the properties of a triangle, where the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°. In triangle ABE, ∠ABE + ∠AEB + ∠BAE = 180°.\n\nStep 5: Plug in the known angle values to find ∠BAE: 125.0° + 90° + ∠BAE = 180°.

        "solution": "Step 1: 确认已知信息。对角线AC的长度是4厘米，三角形ACD的总边长是14厘米。\nStep 2: 由于三角形ACD的总边长是14厘米，我们可以计算出AD和CD两边的长度之和。即14厘米减去AC的长度4厘米，得到AD和CD两边的长度之和为10厘米。\nStep 3: 在平行四边形ABCD中，对边相等，所以AB = CD，BC = AD。\nStep 4: 计算AB和BC的长度。由于AB = CD，BC = AD，并且AD和CD的总长度为10厘米，所以AB和BC的总长度也为10厘米。\nStep 5: 计算平行四边形ABCD的总周长。将对角线AC的长度4厘米加上AB和BC的总长度10厘米，再加上AD和CD的总长度10厘米。\nStep 6: 将各边长度相加，得出平行四边形ABCD的总周长为4厘米 + 10厘米 + 10厘米 = 24厘米。\n\nThe answer is 平行四边形ABCD的总周长是24厘米。",

The length of the diagonal AC is 4 cm and the total perimeter of triangle ACD is 14 cm.\nStep 2: Subtract the length of AC from the total perimeter of triangle ACD to find the sum of the lengths of sides AD and CD: 14 cm - 4 cm = 8 cm.\nStep 3: Since AD and CD are sides of the parallelogram as well, and the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, then AB = CD and BC = AD.\nStep 4: Since we've established AB + BC = AD + CD = 8 cm, we can now calculate the total perimeter of parallelogram ABCD by adding the lengths of all four sides.\nStep 5: To find the perimeter of the parallelogram, we simply sum the lengths of AB, BC, CD, and DA.

Since EOF is 40 degrees, angle EOD is 180 degrees / 40 degrees = 4.5 times EOF.\nStep 7: Determine that there is a mistake in the previous step: angle EOF is part of angle EOD and not the other way around. Therefore, angle EOD consists of two EOF angles plus the straight angle DOF, which is 180 degrees.\nStep 8: Sum up the angles to find angle EOD: angle EOF (40 degrees) + angle DOF (180 degrees) + angle EOF (40 degrees) which is 40 + 180 + 40.\nStep 9: Add the angles to get the measurement of angle EOD: 40 + 180 + 40 = 260 degrees.\n\nThe answer is 260 degrees.",

        "solution": "Step 1: Recognize that AD is the median of triangle ABC, which means point D is the midpoint of BC.\nStep 2: Since E is the midpoint of AD, we then know that AE = ED.\nStep 3: Observe that triangle ABE and triangle ADE share the same height from A and have equal bases AE and ED.\nStep 4: Consequently, the areas of triangles ABE and ADE are equal. Let the area of triangle ABE be x; thus, the area of triangle ADE is also x.\nStep 5: Because D is the midpoint of BC, triangle ADB has the same base length as triangle ADC, and they share the same height from A.\nStep 6: Thus, the area of triangle ADB is equal to the area of triangle ADC.\nStep 7: The area of triangle ABE is ½ the area of triangle ADB (since E is the midpoint of AD). If the area of triangle ABE is x, the area of triangle ADB is 2x.\nStep 8: Similarly, the area of triangle ADC is also 2x.\nStep 9: The total area of triangle ABC is the sum of the areas of triangles ADB and ADC, which is 2x + 2x.\nStep 10: Add the areas for the whole triangle: 2x + 2x = 4x.\nStep 11: Now, we know that the area of triangle ABC is given to be 8 times the area of triangle ABE, which is 8x.\nStep 12: Equate the two expressions for the area of triangle ABC: 4x = 8x.\n\nMissing some steps to solve the problem. Let's continue:\nStep 13: Since the total area of triangle ABC is made up of the areas of triangles ADE, ADB, and ADC (with ADE already established as x and ADB + ADC together known to be equal to 4x), we need to establish the ratio of the areas correctly.\nStep 14: Note that triangle ABE constitutes one part of the four equal parts into which triangle ABC is divided by segments AD and BE.\nStep 15: That means the area of triangle ABE is 1/4 of the total area of triangle ABC.\nStep 16: If the area of triangle ABE is x, then the total area of triangle ABC is 4 * x, or 4x.\nStep 17: The given total area is 8 times the area of triangle ABE, hence the total area of triangle ABC is also 8x.\nStep 18: Setting the two expressions for the total area of triangle ABC to be equal, we have 4x = 8x.\nStep 19: This is a contradiction because it would require x to be 0 for equality to hold, which doesn't make sense in the context of the area of a triangle.\nStep 20: Realize the mistake in step 18. Since we established that the area of triangle ABE is x and it's 1/4 of the total area of triangle ABC, we should multiply x by 4 to find the total area.\nStep 21: So, the correct total area of triangle ABC is 4 * x = 4x, which we are told is equal to 8 times the area of triangle ABE.\nStep 22: Therefore, 4x should be set equal to 8x, where x represents the area of triangle ABE.\nStep 23: Upon reevaluating, it's clear that there has been a misunderstanding in the initial steps. The area of triangle ABC is actually made up of two areas of 4x each (from triangle ADB and triangle ADC), not two of 2x each. Let's correct this.\nStep 24: Hence, we should summarize that triangle ABC is divided equally into four triangles of equal area by its medians: ABE, ADE, BDC, and ADC.\nStep 25: Each of these four triangles has an area of x, as established for triangle ABE.\nStep 26: To find the area of triangle ABC, we multiply the area of one of the smaller triangles (x) by 4, since there are four of them.\nStep 27: Therefore, the correct relationship is 4x = the area of triangle ABC.\nStep 28: We are given that the area of triangle ABC is 8 times the area of triangle ABE, so we substitute in the value of 8x for the area of triangle ABC.\nStep 29: Aligning the two expressions, we now have 4x = 8x for the total area of triangle ABC, which must be a mistake.\nStep 30: Correcting the error, we should compare the number of triangle ABE areas in triangle ABC to what is given. There are four such areas in triangle ABC as each of the four triangles within ABC is equal in area to ABE.\nStep 31: Therefore, the correct expression would be 4 * the area of ABE = the total area of triangle ABC.\nStep 32: The given information states that the total area of triangle ABC is 8 times the area of ABE, hence 8 * the area of ABE = the total area of triangle ABC.\nStep 33: Putting it all together, since 4 * the area of ABE is equal to the total area of triangle ABC and is also equal to 8 times the area of ABE, we can deduce the final value of x.\n\nThe answer is x = 2.",

        "solution": "Step 1: Identify the known information from the question and the given diagram. We are given a circle with center O and a radius of 2 units. Angle C measures 30 degrees. Radius OD forms a 75-degree angle with chord AB.\n\nStep 2: Determine the relationship between the angles and sides in the circle. Since ∠COD is an angle emanating from the center to a chord, it subtends two equal angles on the circle's circumference (angle CAB and angle CDB).\n\nStep 3: Given that angle C is 30 degrees and OD creates a 75-degree angle with AB, we can determine angle COD is actually twice the angle CAB because angles at the center of a circle are twice angles at the circumference on the same arc. Therefore, ∠CAB is half of 75 degrees which is 37.5 degrees.\n\nStep 4: Now we have a triangle CAB with angle C being 30 degrees and angle CAB being 37.5 degrees. Since the sum of angles in a triangle equals 180 degrees, angle CBA can be calculated. Angle CBA = 180 - 30 - 37.5 = 112.5 degrees.\n\nStep 5: Use the Law of Cosines to solve for the length of AB since we have a triangle and the angles opposed to it. The formula is AB^2 = AC^2 + CB^2 - 2(AC)(CB)cos(CBA).\n\nStep 6: Plug in the values: AC and CB are both radii of the circle, so AC = CB = 2 units. Angle CBA is 112.5 degrees. So, AB^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 - 2(2)(2)cos(112.5 degrees).\n\nStep 7: Calculate using the known values: AB^2 = 4 + 4 - 16*cos(112.5 degrees).\n\nStep 8: Since the cosine of an angle greater than 90 degrees is negative, and since we are subtracting this value, AB^2 will include the addition of this positive value. Without a calculator, we cannot compute the exact value, but the cosine of 112.5 degrees is approximately -0.3827.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, AB^2 ≈ 8 - 16*(-0.3827) = 8 + 16*0.3827.\n\nStep 10: Complete the arithmetic operation: AB^2 ≈ 8 + 6.1232 which gives AB^2 ≈ 14.1232.\n\nStep 11: Since we are interested in the length of AB and not AB^2, we take the square root of 14.1232 to get the length of AB. AB ≈ √14.1232.\n\nStep 12: Provide the final approximate length of AB, which would be closest to the square root value of the sum calculated. AB ≈ √14.1232 ≈ 3.76 units.\n\nThe answer is AB ≈ 3.76 units.",

        "solution": "Step 1: 识别给定信息。已知半径为x的圆O，弦AB的长度为2，以及∠C为30°。\nStep 2: 确定相关的几何规则。在圆中，通过圆心的线段（半径）垂直于弦的中点将弦二等分。\nStep 3: 利用圆的性质确认OC垂直于AB，并将AB二等分于点D。此时，OD是半径，长度为x，AD是弦AB的一半，长度为1。\nStep 4: 观察到∆ODC形成一个直角三角形，其中∠C为30°，OD为斜边，CD为对边。\nStep 5: 应用特殊角的三角函数关系知道在30°的直角三角形中，对边与斜边的比值是1:2。\nStep 6: 因此，CD的长度为x/2。\nStep 7: 知道OC为半径，长度为x，OD为半径，也是x，计算DC为半径与OD的差，即x - x/2 = x/2。\nStep 8: 因为在直角三角形∆ODC中，OD为斜边，CD为对边，可以用Pythagoras定理表示为 OC^2 = OD^2 - CD^2。\nStep 9: 代入已知的长度，得到 x^2 = x^2 - (x/2)^2。\nStep 10: 简化得到 x^2 = x^2 - x^2/4。\nStep 11: 将方程变形为 x^2/4 = 0。\nStep 12: 解得 x = 0，但这与题目中半径为正值的假设矛盾，因此我们需要重新检查我们的计算过程。\nStep 13: 重新审视直角三角形∆ODC，我们有OC = x，OD = x，CD = x/2。代入Pythagoras定理应该是 OC^2 = OD^2 + CD^2。\nStep 14: 正确代入长度得到 x^2 = x^2 + (x/2)^2。\nStep 15: 计算得到 0 = x^2/4，这意味着 x^2 = 0，但这又与半径为正值的假设矛盾。\nStep 16: 我们可能在应用Pythagoras定理时犯了错误。在直角三角形∆ODC中，OD和DC是两条直角边，OC是斜边。正确的应用是 OC^2 = OD^2 + DC^2。\nStep 17: 代入已知的长度，得到 x^2 = x^2 + (x/2)^2。\nStep 18: 简化得到 0 = (x/2)^2。\nStep 19: 解得 x/2 = 0，这意味着 x = 0，但这又与半径为正值的假设矛盾。我们的假设里可能存在问题。\nStep 20: 我们需要重新审视问题和图形。我们忽略了三角形ODC并不是一个30°-60°-90°三角形，因为点D并不在弦AB的中点。\n\n正确的步骤应该是：\n\nStep 1: 识别给定信息。半径x，弦AB长度为2，∠C为30°。\nStep 2: 分析图形，根据∠C为30°，可以确定ODC是一个等腰三角形，因为OD和OC都是半径。\nStep 3: 确定ODC是等边三角形，因为两个角都是30°，第三个角也是30°（等腰三角形底角相等，且三角形内角和为180°）。\nStep 4: 由于ODC是等边三角形，因此OD=DC=OC=x。\nStep 5: 因为∠C是30°，所以∠DOB是60°。\nStep 6: 现在我们有一个DOB三角形，它是一个30°-60°-90°三角形，其中DB是最长边，即斜边。\nStep 7: 在30°-60°-90°三角形中，最长边（斜边）是最短边（对30°角的边）的两倍。\nStep 8: AB是弦，BD是AB的一半，所以BD=AB/2=1。\nStep 9: DB作为斜边，是BD的两倍，所以DB=2*BD=2*1=2。\nStep 10: 因为DB是半径，所以DB=x。\nStep 11: 从而我们得出x=2。\n\n答案是x的值是2。",

The correct approach should involve recognizing that the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other at right angles and using the properties of a right-angled triangle formed by half the diagonal and the sides of the rectangle. The correct calculation should lead to a different result for the length of BD. Therefore, the final answer of BD = 2√3 is incorrect."

Since ABCD is a diamond, each side is equal in length.\nStep 3: Calculate the length of one side by dividing the perimeter by 4 (since there are 4 equal sides in a rhombus). This is given by 12 / 4 = 3.\nStep 4: Identify that diagonal AC divides the diamond ABCD into two congruent equilateral triangles, since ∠BAD is 120 degrees and the adjacent angles are equal, making them 60 degrees each for an equilateral triangle.\nStep 5: In an equilateral triangle with side length 3, the altitude bisects the side it meets. Thus, diagonal AC is twice the length of the altitude.\nStep 6: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the altitude (h) of one of the two congruent equilateral triangles. The altitude forms a right triangle with half of one side of the diamond (1.5 units) and the full altitude (h) as legs, and the side of the equilateral triangle (3 units) as the hypotenuse. Here, \\(h = \\sqrt{3^2 - 1.5^2}\\).\nStep 7: Calculate the altitude using the result of step 6: \\(h = \\sqrt{9 - 2.25}\\).\nStep 8: Calculate the altitude: \\(h = \\sqrt{6.75}\\).\nStep 9: Since the diagonal AC of the rhombus is twice the altitude of one of the equal triangles formed by AC, we double the altitude to find \\(x\\): \\(x = 2 \\times \\sqrt{6.75}\\).\nStep 10: Calculate the exact value of \\(x\\): \\(x = 2 \\times \\sqrt{6.75}\\).\nStep 11: Since \\(\\sqrt{6.75}\\) is equivalent to \\(\\sqrt{27/4}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\sqrt{27}/\\sqrt{4}\\) and then to \\((3 \\times \\sqrt{3})/2\\), multiply this by 2 to find the exact value of x: \\(x = 2 \\times ((3 \\times \\sqrt{3})/2)\\).\nStep 12: Simplify to find the exact value of \\(x\\): \\(x = 3 \\times \\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nThe answer is \\(x = 3 \\times \\sqrt{3}\\).",

        "solution": "Step 1: Acknowledge the given information from the question and the diagram:\n- AB is bisected perpendicularly at D, and this perpendicular line meets BC at E.\n- AB = 6 units\n- Distance from D to BC is 2 units, which is the length of DE since DE is perpendicular to BC.\n- The perimeter of ΔACE is given as 13 units.\n\nStep 2: Use the properties of the perpendicular bisector and the given lengths to find AE and EC.\n- Since AB is 6 units and D bisects it, DB = 3 units.\n- AE comprises AD (which is equal to DB) and DE. So, AE = DB + DE = 3 + 2 = 5 units.\n\nStep 3: Determine the perimeter of ΔABC using the perimeter of ΔACE.\n- We have AE = 5 units and the perimeter of ΔACE as 13 units.\n- To find EC, subtract AE from the perimeter of ΔACE and then add AC to get the perimeter of ΔABC.\n- Let's find EC first: Perimeter of ΔACE - AE = 13 units - 5 units = 8 units.\n\nStep 4: Notice that EC is a part of both ΔACE and ΔABC.\n- Since EC is shared by both triangles, when we add AB and BC (to get the perimeter of ΔABC), we don't need to add EC again.\n- Let's find BC now. Since triangle ABC is not given as isosceles or equilateral, we cannot make assumptions about the sides based on DE being 2 units. However, because DE is the perpendicular bisector of AB, and triangles ADE and CDE are congruent (by reflection across DE), EC is also equal to AE.\n- Thus, EC, which we have found to be 8 units, is also equal to CE.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the perimeter of ΔABC.\n- Perimeter of ΔABC = AB + BC + AC\n- Since AB = 6 units, and EC = CE = 8 units (determined from the perimeter of ΔACE), we now know:\nBC = CE + BE (BE is the same length as AB since DE bisects AB perpendicularly and thus AB and BE are reflections of each other across DE).\nBC = 8 + 6 = 14 units.\n\nStep 6: Finally, add AB, BC and AC to find the perimeter of ΔABC.\n- AB is 6 units, BC (which we found in Step 5) is 14 units, and AC (which is the same as EC) is 8 units.\n\nThe answer is: Perimeter of ΔABC = AB + BC + AC = 6 + 14 + 8 = 28 units.",

Therefore, angle ADE and angle EDC each measure 90 degrees because they are congruent and together sum to 180 degrees.\nStep 4: Considering triangle CDE is a right-angled triangle (because of the 90-degree angle at point E), using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can calculate the length of DE if it is required to find BE.\n\nHowever, since DE is not necessary to find BE, we can directly infer that the length of BE is the difference between BC and CE.\n\nStep 5: Triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC by the Angle-Angle similarity postulate, since they both share angle A, and we have established that angle ADE is congruent to angle ABC (because they both are 90 degrees due to DE being an angle bisector and ABCD is a parallelogram).\n\nStep 6: The similarity ratio can be established by comparing the lengths of corresponding sides AB and AD. AB/AD = 4/6 = 2/3.\n\nStep 7: Since the triangles are similar by a ratio of 2/3, and BC = 6 units (same length as AD), then CE must be 2/3 of BC (because CE corresponds to AB in the smaller triangle while BC corresponds to AD in the larger triangle).\n\nStep 8: Calculate CE: CE = 2/3 * BC = 2/3 * 6 = 4 units.\n\nStep 9: Since BE is the remaining part of BC that is not CE, we calculate BE: BE = BC - CE = 6 - 4 = 2 units.\n\nThe answer is 2 units.",

        "solution": "Step 1: Identify given measurements from the information provided. AD equals 6 units, AB equals 4 units, and DC is 2 units shorter than AD.\nStep 2: Calculate the length of DC. Since AD equals 6 units and DC is 2 units shorter, DC equals 6 - 2, which is 4 units.\nStep 3: Recognize that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Therefore, if DE bisects angle ADC, it means point E is the midpoint of BC.\nStep 4: Understand that the parallelogram can be divided into two congruent triangles, ΔADE and ΔBCE, by the diagonal AC. Therefore, AE equals CE, and DE is common for both triangles.\nStep 5: Since AE equals CE and AD equals DC (both are 4 units from Step 2), triangles ΔADE and ΔBCE are congruent by the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) postulate. Because these triangles are congruent, we also know that BE equals AE.\nStep 6: To find the length of AE, we can consider triangle ΔADC. Since E bisects angle ADC, AE is half of the length of AC.\nStep 7: Find the length of AC using the Pythagorean theorem in ΔADC, where AD equals 6 units and CD equals 4 units. AC² = AD² + CD², which means AC² = 6² + 4², so AC² = 36 + 16, which means AC² = 52.\nStep 8: Calculate AC by taking the square root of 52. AC = √52, which can be simplified to AC = √(4*13) = 2√13.\nStep 9: Since AE is half of AC, and AC equals 2√13, AE equals 2√13 / 2, which simplifies to AE equals √13.\nStep 10: As established in Step 5, BE equals AE. Therefore, BE also equals √13.\n\nThe answer is BE equals √13.",

        "solution": "Step 1: Calculate the sum of the ratios given for the angles. The sum is 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.\nStep 2: Divide the full angle at O, which is 360°, by the sum of the ratios to find the value of one part. So, one part is 360° / 9 = 40°.\nStep 3: Use the value of one part to find the angle measure of ∠AOB by multiplying the ratio for ∠AOB, which is 2, by the value of one part. So, ∠AOB = 2 * 40° = 80°.\nStep 4: Rays OM and ON bisect ∠AOB and ∠COD respectively, so ∠MOB = ∠AOB / 2 and ∠CON = ∠COD / 2. Since ∠AOB = 80° and the ratio for ∠COD is twice that of ∠AOB, we can calculate ∠COD as 4 * 40° = 160°.\nStep 5: With ∠COD being 160°, bisected by ON, then ∠CON would be 160° / 2 = 80°.\nStep 6: Now we know ∠MOB = 40° (since it is half of ∠AOB) and ∠CON = 80°. These two angles combine to form ∠MON. Since ∠MON is given as 84°, we have ∠MON = ∠MOB + ∠CON.\nStep 7: We have already found that ∠MOB = 40° (from step 4) and ∠CON = 80° (from step 5). However, we have a discrepancy, as adding these two should equal ∠MON, which is stated to be 84°. There seems to be an issue with the provided angle measure or the given problem setup since our calculated values would sum to 120°.\nStep 8: We need to re-examine the problem statement or the given angle (∠MON) for any possible errors or typos.\nStep 9: Assuming all given information is correct except the measure of ∠MON, we would proceed as such: Since ∠MOB and ∠CON are both half of their original angles, we add them together and see if they equal the given ∠MON. But as mentioned, the sum of 40° and 80° is 120°, not 84°.\n\nThe discrepancy suggests an error in the problem as presented. With consistent values, considering the steps taken and the issue at step 6 and 7, I'm unable to provide a correct final angle measure for ∠AOB that aligns with the given value of ∠MON being 84°. The calculated value for ∠AOB was 80° based on the original problem parameters.\n\nThe answer is... the information given seems inconsistent, but based on the initial ratios, ∠AOB should be 80°. However, this does not reconcile with the given ∠MON of 84°.",

Therefore, 2x + 3x + 4x = 9x = 180 degrees.\nStep 4: Solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 9, so x = 180 / 9 = 20 degrees.\nStep 5: Calculate the measure of ∠AOB using the value of x, ∠AOB = 2x = 2 * 20 degrees = 40 degrees.\nStep 6: Since OM bisects ∠AOB, half of ∠AOB will be ∠AOM, which is ∠AOB / 2 = 40 degrees / 2 = 20 degrees.\nStep 7: Similarly, since ON bisects ∠COD and ∠COD = 4x = 4 * 20 degrees = 80 degrees, half of ∠COD will be ∠CON, which is ∠COD / 2 = 80 degrees / 2 = 40 degrees.\nStep 8: Add ∠AOM and ∠CON to get ∠MON, which is already given as 84 degrees. So, ∠MON = ∠AOM + ∠CON = 20 degrees + 40 degrees = 60 degrees.\nStep 9: Since there is a discrepancy because the given ∠MON is 84 degrees, not 60 degrees, we need to check our calculation. It looks like a possible misunderstanding in the steps might have led to an incorrect conclusion. Let's correct this.\nStep 10: Realize that ∠MON is actually composed of half of ∠AOB and half of ∠COD. If ∠MON = 84 degrees, then the sum of half of ∠AOB and half of ∠COD must equal 84 degrees. Therefore, (2x/2) + (4x/2) = x + 2x = 3x must equal 84 degrees.\nStep 11: Solve for x in the equation 3x = 84 degrees by dividing both sides by 3, so x = 84 degrees / 3 = 28 degrees.\nStep 12: Recalculate the measure of ∠AOB using the correct value of x, which is ∠AOB = 2x = 2 * 28 degrees = 56 degrees.\n\nThe answer is 56 degrees.",
