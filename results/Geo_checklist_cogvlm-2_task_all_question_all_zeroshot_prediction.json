Therefore, s = 2 units.\n\nSince the area of square C is 4 square units, we can rearrange the formula to solve for A, the area of square C: A = s^2.

The formula is \\(d = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\), where 'd' is the diagonal, and 'a' and 'b' are the sides of the square.\nStep 3: Substitute the length of the side of the square, which is 6 units, so that the equation becomes \\(d = \\sqrt{6^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 36}\\).\nStep 4: Calculate the square root, which gives \\( d = \\sqrt{72} \\).\nStep 5: Simplify the square root to obtain the diagonal, which is \\( d = 6\\sqrt{2} \\) units.\nStep 6: Recognize that the diagonal of the square is the diameter of the circle.\nStep 7: The radius of the circle is half of the diameter, so the radius \\( r \\) is \\( 6\\sqrt{2} / 2 = 3\\sqrt{2} \\) units.\nStep 8: Use the formula for the area of a circle, \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\), and substitute the radius.\nStep 9: Calculate the area using the radius, \\( A = \\pi (3\\sqrt{2})^2 = \\pi (9 * 3) = \\pi (27) \\).\nStep 10: Therefore, the area of the circle is \\( 27\\pi \\) square units.\nThe answer is \\( x = 27 \\).",

First, we'll use the information that the line segment CE divides ∠BCD into two equal angles. This means ∠BCD = 2(90°) = 180°. \n\n2. Since ∠BCD is a right angle, ∠ACE is also a right angle. Therefore, ∠ACE = 90°. \n\n3. The angles of a parallelogram sum up to 360°. Thus, ∠BCE + ∠ECD + ∠ACE + ∠DBE = 360°.\n\n4. We know that ∠ECD + ∠ACE = 180° because ∠BCE + ∠ACE equals 180° and ∠BCE is half of that, so ∠ECD + ∠ACE = 180°.\n\n5. Since ∠ECD + ∠ACE equals 180° and ∠ECD is 90°, ∠ACE is also 90°.\n\n6. Now we can use the fact that ∠ACE is a right angle. Therefore, ∠ACE is also 90°.\n\n7. From the given information, ∠BCE + ∠ACE = 180° and ∠ACE = 90°. This means ∠BCE = 180° - 90° = 90°.\n\n8. The angles of a parallelogram are complementary, so ∠BCE + ∠DBE = 180°.\n\n9. Since ∠BCE equals 90° and ∠DBE is the measure of side AB, we can set up the equation ∠BCE + ∠DBE = 180° to solve for AB.\n\n10. Adding both angles together, we get ∠BCE + ∠DBE = 180°. Since ∠BCE is 90°, this means ∠DBE = 180° - 90° = 90°.\n\n11. Since ∠DBE is the measure of side AB, the length of AB is 90 units.\n\nThe length of side AB in the given parallelogram is 90 units."

Since segment AB is equal to segment AC, we can use the sine law of a triangle to solve for the angle ∠BOC.\n\nLet's label the length of segment AB and AC as x. According to the sine law, the sine of angle ∠BOC (which we are trying to find) is opposite side OB divided by the hypotenuse OC. However, we do not have the length of side OB or the hypotenuse OC directly, but we can use the given information that ∠ABC is 65 degrees.\n\nHere's how we can solve for ∠BOC using the sine law:\n\n\\(\\sin(65^{\\circ}) = \\frac{OB}{OC}\\)\n\nSince we are given that AB = AC, we can substitute AB for AC in the equation:\n\n\\(\\sin(65^{\\circ}) = \\frac{OB}{AB}\\)\n\nNow, we can use the fact that AB = AC to find OB:\n\n\\(OB = AB = AC\\)\n\nUsing this in the sine equation, we get:\n\n\\(\\sin(65^{\\circ}) = \\frac{OB}{OB}\\)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\(\\sin(65^{\\circ}) = 1\\)\n\nSince the sine of an angle in a right triangle is always equal to the length of the hypotenuse divided by the length of the adjacent side, this means that OB is equal to the length of the hypotenuse OC. \n\nWe can now use the Pythagorean theorem to find OC. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, for triangle OBC, we have:\n\n\\(OC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2\\)\n\nSince AB = AC, this simplifies to:\n\n\\(OC^2 = 2AB^2\\)\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem again, we can solve for OC:\n\n\\(OC = \\sqrt{2}AB\\)\n\nNow that we have OC, we can use it to find ∠BOC. The angle ∠BOC is the complement of ∠ABC, so we can find ∠BOC by subtracting ∠ABC from 180 degrees:\n\n\\(\\angle BOC = 180^{\\circ} - \\angle ABC\\)\n\nSubstituting in the known measure of ∠ABC:\n\n\\(\\angle BOC = 180^{\\circ} - 65^{\\circ}\\)\n\n\\(\\angle BOC = 115^{\\circ}\\)\n\nTherefore, the measure of angle ∠BOC is 115 degrees."

To find the length of the longer diagonal, we can use the formula for the area of a rhombus, which is A = 1/2 * (2 * x * x), where x is the length of one diagonal. We can rearrange the formula to A = x^2 and then solve for x. However, since the length of the longer diagonal is twice as long as the shorter diagonal, we can also use the formula for the perimeter of a rhombus, which is P = 2 * (x + x), where x is the length of one diagonal. Solving for x in the formula P = 2 * x gives us x = P/2. Since the perimeter is twice the length of the longer diagonal, we can substitute P = 2 * x into the original formula for the area, A = x^2, to get A = (2 * x)^2. Since A = 169, we have (2 * x)^2 = 169, which can be simplified to 4x^2 = 169. Dividing both sides by 4 gives x^2 = 42.5. Taking the square root of both sides, we find x = ±2.13. Since the length of the diagonal cannot be negative, we have x = 2.13. The length of the longer diagonal is therefore 2 * x = 4.26."

However, if we had the length of DE available, we could then find BF by subtracting DE from 8 as per the relationship in Step 13.\n\nSince an image has been provided but I, as an AI, am unable to perform calculations based on visual data or make assumptions beyond the information presented in text, we will reach a point where further information is required to solve for the length of BF.\n\nThe answer is: To solve for the length of BF, more information is needed about the length of either AB or AC, or the length of DE directly.

        "solution": "Step 1: Recognize that AD is the median of triangle ABC, which means point D is the midpoint of BC.\nStep 2: Since E is the midpoint of AD, we then know that AE = ED.\nStep 3: Observe that triangle ABE and triangle ADE share the same height from A and have equal bases AE and ED.\nStep 4: Consequently, the areas of triangles ABE and ADE are equal. Let the area of triangle ABE be x; thus, the area of triangle ADE is also x.\nStep 5: Because D is the midpoint of BC, triangle ADB has the same base length as triangle ADC, and they share the same height from A.\nStep 6: Thus, the area of triangle ADB is equal to the area of triangle ADC.\nStep 7: The area of triangle ABE is ½ the area of triangle ADB (since E is the midpoint of AD). If the area of triangle ABE is x, the area of triangle ADB is 2x.\nStep 8: Similarly, the area of triangle ADC is also 2x.\nStep 9: The total area of triangle ABC is the sum of the areas of triangles ADB and ADC, which is 2x + 2x.\nStep 10: Add the areas for the whole triangle: 2x + 2x = 4x.\nStep 11: Now, we know that the area of triangle ABC is given to be 8 times the area of triangle ABE, which is 8x.\nStep 12: Equate the two expressions for the area of triangle ABC: 4x = 8x.\n\nMissing some steps to solve the problem. Let's continue:\nStep 13: Since the total area of triangle ABC is made up of the areas of triangles ADE, ADB, and ADC (with ADE already established as x and ADB + ADC together known to be equal to 4x), we need to establish the ratio of the areas correctly.\nStep 14: Note that triangle ABE constitutes one part of the four equal parts into which triangle ABC is divided by segments AD and BE.\nStep 15: That means the area of triangle ABE is 1/4 of the total area of triangle ABC.\nStep 16: If the area of triangle ABE is x, then the total area of triangle ABC is 4 * x, or 4x.\nStep 17: The given total area is 8 times the area of triangle ABE, hence the total area of triangle ABC is also 8x.\nStep 18: Setting the two expressions for the total area of triangle ABC to be equal, we have 4x = 8x.\nStep 19: This is a contradiction because it would require x to be 0 for equality to hold, which doesn't make sense in the context of the area of a triangle.\nStep 20: Realize the mistake in step 18. Since we established that the area of triangle ABE is x and it's 1/4 of the total area of triangle ABC, we should multiply x by 4 to find the total area.\nStep 21: So, the correct total area of triangle ABC is 4 * x = 4x, which we are told is equal to 8 times the area of triangle ABE.\nStep 22: Therefore, 4x should be set equal to 8x, where x represents the area of triangle ABE.\nStep 23: Upon reevaluating, it's clear that there has been a misunderstanding in the initial steps. The area of triangle ABC is actually made up of two areas of 4x each (from triangle ADB and triangle ADC), not two of 2x each. Let's correct this.\nStep 24: Hence, we should summarize that triangle ABC is divided equally into four triangles of equal area by its medians: ABE, ADE, BDC, and ADC.\nStep 25: Each of these four triangles has an area of x, as established for triangle ABE.\nStep 26: To find the area of triangle ABC, we multiply the area of one of the smaller triangles (x) by 4, since there are four of them.\nStep 27: Therefore, the correct relationship is 4x = the area of triangle ABC.\nStep 28: We are given that the area of triangle ABC is 8 times the area of triangle ABE, so we substitute in the value of 8x for the area of triangle ABC.\nStep 29: Aligning the two expressions, we now have 4x = 8x for the total area of triangle ABC, which must be a mistake.\nStep 30: Correcting the error, we should compare the number of triangle ABE areas in triangle ABC to what is given. There are four such areas in triangle ABC as each of the four triangles within ABC is equal in area to ABE.\nStep 31: Therefore, the correct expression would be 4 * the area of ABE = the total area of triangle ABC.\nStep 32: The given information states that the total area of triangle ABC is 8 times the area of ABE, hence 8 * the area of ABE = the total area of triangle ABC.\nStep 33: Putting it all together, since 4 * the area of ABE is equal to the total area of triangle ABC and is also equal to 8 times the area of ABE, we can deduce the final value of x.\n\nThe answer is x = 2.",

        "solution": "Step 1: Identify the known information from the question and the given diagram. We are given a circle with center O and a radius of 2 units. Angle C measures 30 degrees. Radius OD forms a 75-degree angle with chord AB.\n\nStep 2: Determine the relationship between the angles and sides in the circle. Since ∠COD is an angle emanating from the center to a chord, it subtends two equal angles on the circle's circumference (angle CAB and angle CDB).\n\nStep 3: Given that angle C is 30 degrees and OD creates a 75-degree angle with AB, we can determine angle COD is actually twice the angle CAB because angles at the center of a circle are twice angles at the circumference on the same arc. Therefore, ∠CAB is half of 75 degrees which is 37.5 degrees.\n\nStep 4: Now we have a triangle CAB with angle C being 30 degrees and angle CAB being 37.5 degrees. Since the sum of angles in a triangle equals 180 degrees, angle CBA can be calculated. Angle CBA = 180 - 30 - 37.5 = 112.5 degrees.\n\nStep 5: Use the Law of Cosines to solve for the length of AB since we have a triangle and the angles opposed to it. The formula is AB^2 = AC^2 + CB^2 - 2(AC)(CB)cos(CBA).\n\nStep 6: Plug in the values: AC and CB are both radii of the circle, so AC = CB = 2 units. Angle CBA is 112.5 degrees. So, AB^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 - 2(2)(2)cos(112.5 degrees).\n\nStep 7: Calculate using the known values: AB^2 = 4 + 4 - 16*cos(112.5 degrees).\n\nStep 8: Since the cosine of an angle greater than 90 degrees is negative, and since we are subtracting this value, AB^2 will include the addition of this positive value. Without a calculator, we cannot compute the exact value, but the cosine of 112.5 degrees is approximately -0.3827.\n\nStep 9: Therefore, AB^2 ≈ 8 - 16*(-0.3827) = 8 + 16*0.3827.\n\nStep 10: Complete the arithmetic operation: AB^2 ≈ 8 + 6.1232 which gives AB^2 ≈ 14.1232.\n\nStep 11: Since we are interested in the length of AB and not AB^2, we take the square root of 14.1232 to get the length of AB. AB ≈ √14.1232.\n\nStep 12: Provide the final approximate length of AB, which would be closest to the square root value of the sum calculated. AB ≈ √14.1232 ≈ 3.76 units.\n\nThe answer is AB ≈ 3.76 units.",

To find AB, we will use the law of sines.\n\nFirst, let's find the length of OD. The law of sines states that the side opposite the angle of a triangle is proportional to the sine of that angle, and the two sides adjacent to that angle are proportional to the two cosines of that angle. Here, OD is the side opposite angle 30°, and AB is one of the sides adjacent to angle 30°. So, OD/AB = sin(30°) / cos(30°). Using trigonometry, we find OD/AB ≈ 1.6667.\n\nNow, we can use the information that the length of OD is twice the length of AB. Therefore, OD = 2 * AB. Substituting OD into the original proportion, we get OD/AB = sin(30°) / cos(30°), which gives us AB ≈ 0.8667 * OD. \n\nSince OD is approximately 1.6667, we find AB ≈ 0.8667 * 1.6667, which is approximately 1.4371. \n\nThus, the length of AB is approximately 1.4371 units."

So the scale factor $k = \\frac{DF}{FC} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nStep 5: Determine the unknown sides. We need to find the lengths of $DE$ and $EF$. These will be in the same ratio as $DF$ to $FC$.\n\nStep 6: Use the perimeter of $\\triangle CBF$ to find the remaining side. The perimeter of $\\triangle CBF$ is given as 27. We have $FC=8$ and need to find $BF$ and $BC$. Let's denote the length of $BF$ as $b$ and the length of $BC$ as $c$. The perimeter is the sum of the sides, so we have $8 + b + c = 27$.\n\nStep 7: Solve the equation for $b+c$. From the equation, $b + c = 27 - 8 = 19$. Unfortunately, without more information, we cannot find the exact lengths of $BF$ and $BC$ separately, but we can express one in terms of the other, such as $b = 19 - c$.\n\nStep 8: Apply the scale factor to find the sides of $\\triangle DEF$. If we denote the lengths of $DE$ as $d$ and $EF$ as $f$, because the triangles are similar, they must satisfy $d = k \\cdot c$ and $f = k \\cdot b$ where $k$ is the scale factor found in Step 4.\n\nStep 9: Use the scale factor to find the perimeter of $\\triangle DEF$. The perimeter of $\\triangle DEF$ is $d + f + DF$.

Unfortunately, without more information, we cannot find the exact lengths of $BF$ and $BC$ separately, but we can express one in terms of the other, such as $b = 19 - c$.\n\nStep 8: Apply the scale factor to find the sides of $\\triangle DEF$. If we denote the lengths of $DE$ as $d$ and $EF$ as $f$, because the triangles are similar, they must satisfy $d = k \\cdot c$ and $f = k \\cdot (c - 8)$ where $k$ is the scale factor found in Step 4.\n\nStep 9: Use the scale factor to find the perimeter of $\\triangle DEF$. The perimeter of $\\triangle DEF$ is $d + f + DF$. Using the scale factor, we get $d = k \\cdot c$, $f = k \\cdot (c - 8)$, and we know $DF = 6$.\n\nStep 10: Express the perimeter of $\\triangle DEF$ using known variables. The perimeter $P_{DEF} = d + f + 6 = k \\cdot c + k \\cdot (c - 8) + 6$.\n\nStep 11: Substitute the values of $k$, $b+c$, and $DF$. We have $k = \\frac{3}{4}$ and $b + c = 19$. So, $P_{DEF} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot c + \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot (c - 8) + 6$.\n\nStep 12: Calculate the perimeter of $\\triangle DEF$. Performing the calculation, $P_{DEF} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot c + \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot (c - 8) + 6 = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 19 + \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 11 + 6 = 14.25 + 8.25 + 6 = 28.5$.\n\nThe answer is 28.5.",

        "solution": "Step 1: Understand the concept of similar triangles. Similar triangles have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Their corresponding sides are proportional, and their corresponding angles are equal.\n\nStep 2: Identify the triangles that are similar. We have $\\triangle DEF \\sim \\triangle CBF$.\n\nStep 3: List the known side lengths. We know $DF = 6$ and $FC = 8$. Since $\\triangle DEF \\sim \\triangle CBF$, the side $DF$ of $\\triangle DEF$ is corresponding to side $FC$ of $\\triangle CBF$.\n\nStep 4: Compute the scale factor. To find the scale factor between the similar triangles, divide one of the known corresponding sides by the other. So the scale factor $k = \\frac{DF}{FC} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nStep 5: Determine the unknown sides. We need to find the lengths of $DE$ and $EF$. These will be in the same ratio as $DF$ to $FC$.\n\nStep 6: Use the perimeter of $\\triangle CBF$ to find the remaining side. The perimeter of $\\triangle CBF$ is given as 27. We have $FC=8$ and need to find $BF$ and $BC$. Let's denote the length of $BF$ as $b$ and the length of $BC$ as $c$. The perimeter is the sum of the sides, so we have $8 + b + c = 27$.\n\nStep 7: Solve the equation for $b+c$. From the equation, $b + c = 27 - 8 = 19$. Unfortunately, without more information, we cannot find the exact lengths of $BF$ and $BC$ separately, but we can express one in terms of the other, such as $b = 19 - c$.\n\nStep 8: Apply the scale factor to find the sides of $\\triangle DEF$. If we denote the lengths of $DE$ as $d$ and $EF$ as $f$, because the triangles are similar, they must satisfy $d = k \\cdot c$ and $f = k \\cdot b$ where $k$ is the scale factor found in Step 4.\n\nStep 9: Use the scale factor to find the perimeter of $\\triangle DEF$. The perimeter of $\\triangle DEF$ is $d + f + DF$. Using the scale factor, we get $d = k \\cdot c$, $f = k \\cdot b$, and we know $DF = 6$.\n\nStep 10: Express the perimeter of $\\triangle DEF$ using known variables. The perimeter $P_{DEF} = d + f + 6 = k \\cdot c + k \\cdot b + 6 = k \\cdot (b + c) + 6$.\n\nStep 11: Substitute the values of $k$, $b+c$, and $DF$. We have $k = \\frac{3}{4}$ and $b + c = 19$. So, $P_{DEF} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 16 + 6$.\n\nStep 12: Calculate the perimeter of $\\triangle DEF$. Performing the calculation, $P_{DEF} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 16 + 6 = \\frac{48}{4} + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18$.\n\nThe answer is 18.",

The law of sines states that the ratio of the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the lengths of the sides of a second triangle, corresponding to the same angles, is constant. In this case, the two triangles are isosceles triangles with the same base length, so the ratio is 1:1.\n\nUsing the lengths of the sides given:\nBC = 5\nCG = 2GB\nSo, CG = 2(5) = 10\nEF = 5\nEF = 2(5) = 10\n\nUsing the law of sines with ∠E = 90°, ∠G = 66°, and ∠F = 88°:\n\\frac{EF}{sin E} = \\frac{CG}{sin G} = \\frac{EF}{sin F}\n\\frac{10}{sin 90} = \\frac{10}{sin 88} = \\frac{10}{0.801} = 12.46\n\nTherefore, the measure of angle E is approximately 90° - 12.46° = 77.54°. \n\nThe correct answer is: 77.54°."

If angle A is 40.0 degrees, then the measure of the arc subtended by angle A is 40.0 degrees of the circle's circumference.\n\nUsing the formula for the measure of an arc (which is the measure of the angle subtended by the arc), we have:\n\nm < A > = (360 degrees / total circumference of the circle) * angle A\n\nNow, since AB is the diameter, the total circumference is twice the diameter. Therefore, the formula becomes:\n\nm < A > = (360 degrees / 2 * AB) * angle A\n\nPlugging in the given information:\n\nm < A > = (360 degrees / (2 * AB)) * 40.0 degrees\n\nFirst, let's find the total circumference of the circle, which is twice the diameter AB. Therefore, the circumference is 2 * AB.\n\nNow, we can rearrange the formula:\n\nm < A > = (360 degrees / circumference) * angle A\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nm < A > = (360 degrees / (2 * AB)) * 40.0 degrees\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n\nm < A > = (360 degrees / 2 * AB) * 40.0 degrees\n\nDividing by 2:\n\nm < A > = (180 degrees / AB) * 40.0 degrees\n\nNow, dividing both sides by 180 degrees to convert from degrees to radians, we get:\n\nm < A > = (1 / AB) radians\n\nSince angle A is 40.0 degrees, we can use trigonometry to find the radian measure of angle A. For a standard angle, you can use the formula:\n\nradians = (degrees * pi / 180)\n\nPlugging in 40.0 degrees:\n\nradians = (40.0 * pi / 180) = (40.0 * 3.14159 / 180) ≈ 0.22159 radians\n\nFinally, using the radian measure of angle A, we can solve for AB:\n\nAB = (1 / m < A >) = (1 / 0.22159 radians) ≈ 4.50452\n\nTo find the measure of angle B, we subtract the measure of angle A from 360 degrees:\n\nm < B > = 360 degrees - m < A > = 360 degrees - 0.22159 radians ≈ 359.77841 degrees\n\nThus, the measure of angle B is approximately 359.77841 degrees."

We can use the tangent ratio to find the length of line segment AC. The tangent of angle ∠2 is the length of AC divided by the length of AB. So, the tangent of ∠2 is AC / AB = 5 / 5 = 1. \n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle formed by line AB and line AC to find the length of AC. The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (AC) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (AB and BC). Since AB is 5 cm, and ∠2 is 65.0°, BC is also 5 cm (because ∠2 is the complement of ∠BAC, which is 90° - 65.0° = 24.9°). So, the square of AC is 5^2 + 5^2 = 25 + 25 = 50. \n\nTaking the square root of both sides of the equation, we get AC = √50, which is approximately 7.07 cm. \n\nUsing the tangent of ∠2, we can find the length of AC.

Therefore, the length of AE can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nAE^2 = AC^2 + CE^2\nAE^2 = 6^2 + x^2\nAE^2 = 36 + x^2\nAE^2 = 36 + x^2\nAE = sqrt(36 + x^2)\n\nNow, to find the perimeter of the triangle ABC, we need to add the lengths of all three sides:\n\nP(ABC) = AB + AC + BC\nP(ABC) = 6 + x + x\n\nP(ABC) = 6 + 2x\n\nTo find the value of x, we can use the fact that the perimeter of the triangle ACE is x:\n\nP(ACE) = AE + AC + CE\nP(ACE) = AE + x + x\nP(ACE) = AE + 2x\n\nSince the perimeter of the triangle ACE is x, we can set up an equation:\n\nP(ACE) = x + 2x\nP(ACE) = 3x\n\nNow, we can use the information that the perimeter of the triangle ABC is 19 to solve for x:\n\nP(ABC) = 6 + 2x\nP(ABC) = 6 + 3x\nP(ABC) = 9x\n\nSince P(ACE) = 3x, we can substitute this into the equation for P(ABC):\n\nP(ABC) = 9x\nP(ABC) = 6 + 3x\nP(ABC) = 9x - 6\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 3 to find x:\n\nx = (9x - 6) / 3\nx = 3x - 2\n\nThe value of x is therefore 3x - 2. To find the value of x, we need to know the length of one side of the triangle ABC.

Since AD equals 6 units and DC is 2 units shorter, DC equals 6 - 2, which is 4 units.\nStep 3: Recognize that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Therefore, if DE bisects angle ADC, it means point E is the midpoint of BC.\nStep 4: Understand that the parallelogram can be divided into two congruent triangles, ΔADE and ΔBCE, by the diagonal AC. Therefore, AE equals CE, and DE is common for both triangles.\nStep 5: Since AE equals CE and AD equals DC (both are 4 units from Step 2), triangles ΔADE and ΔBCE are congruent by the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) postulate. Because these triangles are congruent, we also know that BE equals AE.\nStep 6: To find the length of AE, we can consider triangle ΔADC. Since E bisects angle ADC, AE is half of the length of AC.\nStep 7: Find the length of AC using the Pythagorean theorem in ΔADC, where AD equals 6 units and CD equals 4 units. AC² = AD² + CD², which means AC² = 6² + 4², so AC² = 36 + 16, which means AC² = 52.\nStep 8: Calculate AC by taking the square root of 52. AC = √52, which can be simplified to AC = √(4*13) = 2√13.\nStep 9: Since AE is half of AC, and AC equals 2√13, AE equals 2√13 / 2, which simplifies to AE equals √13.\nStep 10: As established in Step 5, BE equals AE.

The sum is 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.\nStep 2: Divide the full angle at O, which is 360°, by the sum of the ratios to find the value of one part. So, one part is 360° / 9 = 40°.\nStep 3: Use the value of one part to find the angle measure of ∠AOB by multiplying the ratio for ∠AOB, which is 2, by the value of one part. So, ∠AOB = 2 * 40° = 80°.\nStep 4: Rays OM and ON bisect ∠AOB and ∠COD respectively, so ∠MOB = ∠AOB / 2 and ∠CON = ∠COD / 2. Since ∠AOB = 80° and the ratio for ∠COD is twice that of ∠AOB, we can calculate ∠COD as 4 * 40° = 160°.\nStep 5: With ∠COD being 160°, bisected by ON, then ∠CON would be 160° / 2 = 80°.\nStep 6: Now we know ∠MOB = 40° (since it is half of ∠AOB) and ∠CON = 80°. These two angles combine to form ∠MON. Since ∠MON is given as 84°, we have ∠MON = ∠MOB + ∠CON.\nStep 7: We have already found that ∠MOB = 40° (from step 4) and ∠CON = 80° (from step 5). However, we have a discrepancy, as adding these two should equal ∠MON, which is stated to be 84°. There seems to be an issue with the provided angle measure or the given problem setup since our calculated values would sum to 120°.\nStep 8: We need to re-examine the problem statement or the given angle (∠MON) for any possible errors or typos.\nStep 9: Assuming all given information is correct except the measure of ∠MON, we would proceed as such: Since ∠MOB and ∠CON are both half of their original angles, we add them together and see if they equal the given ∠MON. But as mentioned, the sum of 40° and 80° is 120°, not 84°.\n\nThe discrepancy suggests an error in the problem as presented. With consistent values, considering the steps taken and the issue at step 6 and 7, I'm unable to provide a correct final angle measure for ∠AOB that aligns with the given value of ∠MON being 84°. The calculated value for ∠AOB was 80° based on the original problem parameters.\n\nThe answer is... the information given seems inconsistent, but based on the initial ratios, ∠AOB should be 80°.

Since ∠AOC is one of the angles in the system we're trying to solve for, we can use the given information ∠AOC = ∠COD = 90° to find ∠AOD.\n\nNow that we have ∠AOD = ∠COD = 90°, we can use the given information that ∠AOB = ∠COD = ∠COD = 90° to find ∠AOB.\n\nUsing the information that ∠AOB = ∠COD = ∠COD = 90° and ∠MON = 84°, we can set up an equation.\n\n90° = 84° + ∠AOB\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to isolate ∠AOB:\n\n90° - 84° = ∠AOB\n\n∠AOB = 90° - 84°\n\n∠AOB = 6°\n\nSo, the measure of ∠AOB is 6°."
